<center><p>489 OH LORD KNEELED AT YOUR FEET<br/><br/>
  Oh Lord, kneeled at your feet, to give you praises,<br/><br/>
  'Cause I was walking lost without my God;<br/><br/>
  You've brought me with your love to join your people,<br/><br/>
  You adopted me as your son with love.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  I give you thanks, oh my God,<br/><br/>
  Because your Son, His life gave for me;<br/><br/>
  I only ask to serve you faithfully,<br/><br/>
  Because my life is yours Lord, and you are my God.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Remembering that one day, I said with my lips,<br/><br/>
  I swore I'll never leave you oh my Lord;<br/><br/>
  I want to keep my promise that I swore you,<br/><br/>
  'Cause the sinner you love and want to change.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Oh Lord, you've guarded me in all your pathways,<br/><br/>
  In my affliction you have held my hand;<br/><br/>
  And faithfully I'll follow in your pathway,<br/><br/>
'Cause your love gives me strength to march along.</p></center>
