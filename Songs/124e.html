<center><p>124 WHEN MY DEAR LORD JESUS COMES<br/><br/>
  When my dear Lord Jesus comes, I will be waiting,<br/><br/>
  My lamp will be shining on with light and peace;<br/><br/>
  He is ready at the doors, of this I am sure,<br/><br/>
  I know I should be preparing, because He's coming;<br/><br/>
  And I know He won't be late.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  My Lord is coming very soon and filled with glory,<br/><br/>
  To earth He's coming, and I know He won't be late;<br/><br/>
  For us He's coming, His sanctified church, the faithful,<br/><br/>
  The Living God's church, Christ will raise it up that day.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  When my dear Lord Jesus comes, over the clouds,<br/><br/>
  With His angels He will come, I will await;<br/><br/>
  And He always says to me, be very watchful,<br/><br/>
  And also to keep on praying, so He can take me;<br/><br/>
  To His palace far away.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  When my dear Lord Jesus comes, what greatest joy,<br/><br/>
  Because He will come to take, His holy church;<br/><br/>
  I don't want to stay behind, alone in this world,<br/><br/>
  I would like to follow Jesus, up to His kingdom;<br/><br/>
  And with Him I will rejoice.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  When my dear Lord Jesus comes, I will be waiting,<br/><br/>
  I would like to always be, doing His will;<br/><br/>
  And in this way He will take, me to His dwellings,<br/><br/>
  This for me will be a blessing to reign with Jesus;<br/><br/>
Throughout all eternity.</p></center>
