<center><p>019 WHEN I LOOK UNTO THE HEAVENS<br/><br/>
  When I look unto the heavens and the earth,<br/><br/>
  When I consider all the scenery of the sea;<br/><br/>
  In the evenings when I see those bright stars shining,<br/><br/>
  And in the mornings when I hear birds sweetly sing.<br/><br/>
  When I see the shining sun over the hill tops,<br/><br/>
  I then marvel of my God's creative hand;<br/><br/>
  //And I must say to the world with all my soul;<br/><br/>
  None like my God, not one, no other God//<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Many men worship their idols crafted from wood,<br/><br/>
  Gods made of gypsum and those also made of brass;<br/><br/>
  Yet they cannot see, nor hear you, and cannot speak,<br/><br/>
  Though they have feet, these images can't walk at all.<br/><br/>
  But my great God has His great throne high in the heavens,<br/><br/>
  My God lives and He can hear my daily prayers;<br/><br/>
  //In the presence of my God the world does tremble;<br/><br/>
None like my God, not one, no other God//</p></center>
