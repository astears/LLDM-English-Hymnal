<center><p>435 PEOPLE OF GOD<br/><br/>
  People of God make sure you're not left behind,<br/><br/>
  Because of you a nation could be condemned;<br/><br/>
  //Take care of all that our God has given you,<br/><br/>
  And in His mansion you all will have your place//<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Let us take all of our bibles without fear,<br/><br/>
  These are the swords that will give us victory;<br/><br/>
  From all the legions who come to us fearless,<br/><br/>
  But we know with Jesus Christ we will defeat.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Work faithfully in the work of our Lord,<br/><br/>
  As faithful soldiers you'll get through all your toils;<br/><br/>
  //If you do this you'll be able to possess,<br/><br/>
  Eternal life that Christ has promised to us//<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Together brethren let us fight for the work,<br/><br/>
  That Jesus Christ has entrusted with us here;<br/><br/>
  //Because the times are drawing nearer each day,<br/><br/>
Of when we all should be awakened at His voice//</p></center>
