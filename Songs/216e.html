<center><p>216 THIS I HAVE AGAINST YOU<br/><br/>
  This I have against you, says the Lord Almighty God,<br/><br/>
  //You've abandoned me your first love, and rejected all my love//<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Your Lord God is calling now, don't reject His kindness,<br/><br/>
  And if you have lost His love, you can find it once again.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Give back to your God of love, come return to righteousness,<br/><br/>
  //Do the work as when you entered, so over the devil win//<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Humbleness, obedience, is what I demand from you,<br/><br/>
  //So you are able to enter, to the promised land above//<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  God gives two pathways to walk, look so wisely which you walk,<br/><br/>
//And two payments are waiting, which one does your faith wait for//</p></center>
