<center><p>122 WHEN ALONE AND IN SADNESS<br/><br/>
  When alone and in sadness I was,<br/><br/>
  And I lived without hope or any peace;<br/><br/>
  I did call on the Savior of souls,<br/><br/>
  And the healer of my sickness too.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Alone I did talk to my Jesus,<br/><br/>
  Telling him all of my necessities;<br/><br/>
  And He took in his arms all my burdens,<br/><br/>
  And salvation He gave to my soul.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Through this world I did go without Jesus,<br/><br/>
  And despising the love of my Lord;<br/><br/>
  Understanding my terrible fault,<br/><br/>
  I did seek the forgiveness of God.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Now I'm happy and very delighted,<br/><br/>
  Because Jesus my soul He has saved;<br/><br/>
  And if sorrows or doubts wear me out,<br/><br/>
  I acclaim to my Savoir and Lord.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  If you want attain this good fortune,<br/><br/>
  And would like to be saved on this day;<br/><br/>
  You can follow my most humble counsel,<br/><br/>
  And do give all your heart to my Lord<br/><br/>
  2nd. CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Alone you can talk to my God,<br/><br/>
  And tell Him all of your necessities;<br/><br/>
  And He'll take in His arms all your burdens,<br/><br/>
Salvation and wellbeing He'll give.</p></center>
