<center><p>225 GLORY WE'RE SINGING<br/><br/>
  Glory we're singing to Jesus Christ,<br/><br/>
  Who is coming to this earth, with light and peace;<br/><br/>
  He's coming for His pure bride, who is prepared in white,<br/><br/>
  //The lovely church desires now to go with her groom//<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  And now my Brothers sealed in Christ Jesus,<br/><br/>
  We struggle against the prince of darkness;<br/><br/>
  //We see the victory in God's church always,<br/><br/>
  And with His glory Christ will crown us//<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  You who believe in Lord Jesus Christ,<br/><br/>
  May your heart not fall back, but be so strong;<br/><br/>
  Looking at the target: our Savior Jesus Christ,<br/><br/>
  //Triumphant we will be, and Jesus will crown us//<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  When our battle ends in this world,<br/><br/>
  A palm leaf and a robe we'll take with us there;<br/><br/>
  The church of God is calling, for you to be prepared,<br/><br/>
  //So you will be joyful in celestial riches//<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  When in the new city: Jerusalem,<br/><br/>
  We will sing of the victories with all the Saints;<br/><br/>
  Close to God's throne above, all eyes will surely see,<br/><br/>
//There we'll proclaim Hosannas to the King of Israel//</p></center>
