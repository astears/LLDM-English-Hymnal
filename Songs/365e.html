<center><p>365 MY LIFE WAS CRUEL<br/><br/>
  My life was cruel when I wandered in this world,<br/><br/>
  My soul was always lost and without hope;<br/><br/>
  But the great love of Jesus is eternal,<br/><br/>
  He rescued me from a dangerous place.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  With gratitude I glorify His great Name,<br/><br/>
  I manifest His power to the world;<br/><br/>
  There is no love, so immense in this whole world,<br/><br/>
  Just as the love, of Jesus my great King.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Eternal life is what Jesus has promised,<br/><br/>
  If I can persevere in holiness;<br/><br/>
  If I obey His word without exceptions,<br/><br/>
  I know He will give me eternal life.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  So fortunate that day as I remember,<br/><br/>
  When I was rescued from my wickedness;<br/><br/>
  He suffered death because of my transgressions,<br/><br/>
And in the end taught me to do His will.</p></center>
