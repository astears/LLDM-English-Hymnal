<center><p>522 I HAVE BEEN BAPTIZED<br/><br/>
  I have been baptized like my Savior has ordained,<br/><br/>
  What a great joy I do feel deep within my heart;<br/><br/>
  All of my sins have been erased by Jesus Christ,<br/><br/>
  I will arrive to His mansion pure and clean.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  I will follow Jesus Christ,<br/><br/>
  I've given up what the world has offered me;<br/><br/>
  And with the aid of His great light,<br/><br/>
  I will continue in His footsteps all my life.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Goodbye to this world where I once lived in sin,<br/><br/>
  Where all the sins had been destroying my life;<br/><br/>
  I feel a joy after I had been baptized,<br/><br/>
  And to go back to sin again, I'd rather die.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  I follow only the way that is full of faith,<br/><br/>
  That very few people have chosen to pursue;<br/><br/>
  I ask my God to keep me safe in all His love,<br/><br/>
I will arrive to His mansion pure and clean.</p></center>
