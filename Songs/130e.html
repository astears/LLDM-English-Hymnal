<center><p>130 IT'S DESIRED THIS MOUNT OF ZION<br/><br/>
  It's desired, this Mount of Zion,<br/><br/>
  They are running towards it all of the people;<br/><br/>
  Giving glories ever to our King,<br/><br/>
  Tribute praises forever to Him.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Mount of all my sanctity, You will be so named,<br/><br/>
  Zion of the Lamb of love;<br/><br/>
  'Cause in the arms of our God, for you have been marked,<br/><br/>
  And in the great heart of God, you have been sealed too.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Oh you church, so blessed from our God,<br/><br/>
  Because all this world someday will pass away;<br/><br/>
  And to love always our God, forever,<br/><br/>
  To Christ Jesus our King oh praise Him.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  It was Jesus who gave you your life,<br/><br/>
  Consecrated through all of the Lord's virtues;<br/><br/>
  All the children of God do desire.<br/><br/>
To be loved by Him forever more.</p></center>
