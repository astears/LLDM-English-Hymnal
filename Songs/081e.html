<center><p>081 JUST LIKE THE DAWNING<br/><br/>
  Just like the dawning that brings the splendor,<br/><br/>
  And makes the darkness all disappear;<br/><br/>
  Just like the rain in the barren pasture,<br/><br/>
  You are like that with your authority.<br/><br/>
  And the true doctrine that God has left you,<br/><br/>
  Will give all its fruits of holiness;<br/><br/>
  And a new song we'll joyfully sing,<br/><br/>
  For God's election that in His Servant comes to outshine.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Who will they be? Who will sing the glorious song,<br/><br/>
  Who will they be? Wearing vestments that are whitened;<br/><br/>
  Who will they be? Those who will reign with the Redeemer,<br/><br/>
  Who will they be? Those who accept your authority.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  The firmament has been decorated,<br/><br/>
  With all the stars, the sun, and moon;<br/><br/>
  Also the Lord has adorned you Brother,<br/><br/>
  With all the virtues and the election.<br/><br/>
  Sing nightingales and all of the gold finch,<br/><br/>
  The rivers sounding, and mighty sea;<br/><br/>
  Angels are singing, let us be singing,<br/><br/>
  Yes God do bless your great majesty.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  A staff of glory the Lord has left you,<br/><br/>
  A crown of beauty He's placed on you;<br/><br/>
  Of finest pearls it's brightly shinning,<br/><br/>
  Beautiful jewels diamonds they are.<br/><br/>
  The faithful souls who have taken victory,<br/><br/>
  Purest adornments of greatest price;<br/><br/>
  Beautiful glory the Lord has left you,<br/><br/>
Just like He gave to Brother Aaron.</p></center>
