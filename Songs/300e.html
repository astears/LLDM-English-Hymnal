<center><p>300 THE HOPE<br/><br/>
  The hope of every Christian is Jesus,<br/><br/>
  And to rejoice arriving with Christ;<br/><br/>
  In the kingdom of light and of glory,<br/><br/>
  This is where all His children will be.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  There are dwellings where He is awaiting,<br/><br/>
  Filled with life, with joy, and with peace;<br/><br/>
  With His blood He has come to retrieve us,<br/><br/>
  To the faithful He promises aid.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  How often all the faithful have suffered,<br/><br/>
  As they all kept their lives close to Him;<br/><br/>
  And their names have been already written,<br/><br/>
  In the book of the living of God.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  If you would like to fight oh you Christians,<br/><br/>
  You should always ask the Lord for help;<br/><br/>
  With His strength He will help you prevail,<br/><br/>
  If you suffer you will have your prize.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Oh how happy are all of the brothers,<br/><br/>
  Keeping themselves with Christ till the end;<br/><br/>
  They will someday contemplate his dwellings,<br/><br/>
If they suffer with him till the end.</p></center>
