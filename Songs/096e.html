<center><p>096 LAMB OF GOD<br/><br/>
  Lamb of God, who descended from heaven,<br/><br/>
  When you died on the cross, to give us of your light;<br/><br/>
  And save our souls from death,<br/><br/>
  You have shed your immaculate blood;<br/><br/>
  In which my wickedness was erased on the cross,<br/><br/>
  Where you died my Lord Christ.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Now I do praise you my Lord, with all of my loving heart,<br/><br/>
  Because you are my God and my good Savior Lord;<br/><br/>
  The one who died for me.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  You suffered, nailed to the cross of burden,<br/><br/>
  In affliction you showed your great love for me Lord;<br/><br/>
  You have given me peace,<br/><br/>
  You've given all my soul protection;<br/><br/>
  My soul was without God, and in wickedness too,<br/><br/>
  No faith nor salvation.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  You gave Lord, to my life a great treasure,<br/><br/>
  Oh this peace so unique, that I could never find;<br/><br/>
  In this world of fallacy,<br/><br/>
  And now Lord, my soul joyfully praises;<br/><br/>
  I'm enjoying your love that on the painful cross,<br/><br/>
You showed to me one day.</p></center>
