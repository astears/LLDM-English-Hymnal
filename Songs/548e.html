<center><p>548 A STONG TOWER<br/><br/>
  A strong tower is the name of our Lord,<br/><br/>
  Where salvation my soul finds only through Him;<br/><br/>
  He will always be my refuge there's no doubt,<br/><br/>
  Under His wings He will shield me with His love.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  There will be no evil that will harm me here,<br/><br/>
  I embrace my hope in Jesus Christ the Lord;<br/><br/>
  My hope is sustained by He who died for me,<br/><br/>
  I will reach His palace and mansion of light.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Those who place their willingness in Him today,<br/><br/>
  In the asylum of His love they will be raised;<br/><br/>
  From all anguish and all pain they will be saved,<br/><br/>
  So that they may only rejoice in His love.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  For all those who will receive Him on this day,<br/><br/>
  They will have power and virtue as a gift;<br/><br/>
  Christ has said: I give you all my might today,<br/><br/>
  And all those who do believe then will rejoice.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  As an ointment is the name of our Lord,<br/><br/>
  To the soul who can accept His divine love;<br/><br/>
  It will be shed like a scent of tenderness,<br/><br/>
Over all souls who will witness His great love.</p></center>
