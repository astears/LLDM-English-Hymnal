<center><p>160 THE END OF THIS WORLD<br/><br/>
  The end of this world is drawing near,<br/><br/>
  The gospel will have its end that day;<br/><br/>
  We're contemplating all of the signals,<br/><br/>
  As they are written they will all come true.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Beloved friend Jesus Christ is calling,<br/><br/>
  Don't harden your heart when you hear Him;<br/><br/>
  Give yourself to Christ, He wants your soul now,<br/><br/>
  And you'll be resurrected on judgment day.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  On that day people will be in anguish,<br/><br/>
  Desperately worried about their sin;<br/><br/>
  It will be too late for them by that time,<br/><br/>
  All those who preached will no longer exist.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  When in the end the trumpet has sound,<br/><br/>
  Those who believed will have salvation;<br/><br/>
  The righteous judge will give them His sentence,<br/><br/>
  To those found living in their wickedness.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  He will not let them be in His presence,<br/><br/>
  All those who had disobeyed his word;<br/><br/>
  They will be crying and grinding their teeth,<br/><br/>
In the eternal fire they will go.</p></center>
