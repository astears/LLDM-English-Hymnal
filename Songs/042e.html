<center><p>042 TO MAKE READY THE DWELLINGS<br/><br/>
  To make ready the dwellings, He went up to the sky,<br/><br/>
  His redeemed people all give Him glory and give praise.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  ///When the horn blows above/// the world will tremble too.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  A royal chosen priesthood, our God will make His flock,<br/><br/>
  Conforming to His promise, to all of us He made.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  The angels of the heavens come with the Sovereign Lord,<br/><br/>
  All singing Hallelujahs to Savior Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  The golden streets and sidewalks, a sea of crystal too,<br/><br/>
  Every doors' a pearl, how sweet to live up there.<br/><br/>
  5<br/><br/>
  In those streets of gold, my Savior Jesus Christ,<br/><br/>
  His face lights up the city, with His divine light.<br/><br/>
  6<br/><br/>
  And after a thousand years of reigning with my Lord,<br/><br/>
With Him we'll live forever in His divine light.</p></center>
