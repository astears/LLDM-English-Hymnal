<center><p>099 THE BEST DOCTOR OF MY SOUL<br/><br/>
  The best doctor of my soul is Christ,<br/><br/>
  He knows all your aching and your pains;<br/><br/>
  Struggles that you've told Him when you pray,<br/><br/>
  Christ your Savior knows everything well.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Sins and our guilt He took away,<br/><br/>
  Through His shed blood on the wooden cross;<br/><br/>
  You souls who to sin have been tied down,<br/><br/>
  Come to Jesus, liberty you'll find.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Any wave rising too high He'll calm,<br/><br/>
  All the hungry Christ will satisfy;<br/><br/>
  All the sinners who come to Jesus,<br/><br/>
  Will find salvation for their lost souls.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Sinner, if salvation you do seek,<br/><br/>
  Christ the doctor will heal your sick soul;<br/><br/>
  With His right hand He'll will guide your steps,<br/><br/>
And to heaven He will take your soul.</p></center>
