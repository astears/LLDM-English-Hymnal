<center><p>590 OH THE HARVEST TIME<br/><br/>
  Oh the harvest time in heaven is approaching,<br/><br/>
  The harvest fields //of the Lord//<br/><br/>
  Even though those weeds are growing alongside all of those wheat plants,<br/><br/>
  You will separate it Lord.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  // I am wheat// //of the fields// //of the Lord//<br/><br/>
  Through the blood of Jesus Christ and through His greatest power;<br/><br/>
  To His granary I go.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  It seems as I'm contemplating Jesus Christ,<br/><br/>
  Contemplating //all His work//<br/><br/>
  He's rejoicing in the seed that he had planted so happily,<br/><br/>
  With a very lowly heart.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  All the granaries of my Lord are so lovely,<br/><br/>
  I can see them //filled with love//<br/><br/>
  By all those who worked them with love and who were never ashamed to work,<br/><br/>
In the fields of our Lord.</p></center>
