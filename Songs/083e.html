<center><p>083 HOW WILL I EVER REPAY YOU<br/><br/>
  How will I ever repay you my Lord and King,<br/><br/>
  All of the blessings that you've given me in my life;<br/><br/>
  For you have liberated me from death and sorrow,<br/><br/>
  That's why my Lord and God I give you thanks today.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  My life was caught in a most desperate situation,<br/><br/>
  But Jesus Christ came to my rescue with His love;<br/><br/>
  He promised me a beautiful crown up in heaven,<br/><br/>
  If I am faithful till the end of my career.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  And now I come with gratitude to give you my life,<br/><br/>
  For I acknowledge that my life is only yours now;<br/><br/>
  If there is talent or a gift involved in my life,<br/><br/>
Everything Lord unto your altar I present.</p></center>
