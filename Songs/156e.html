<center><p>156 THE DAY PREDICTED<br/><br/>
  The day predicted is coming, Jesus Christ will return,<br/><br/>
  What a sublime apparition, all eyes will witness this;<br/><br/>
  And multitudes of all people, will be around His throne,<br/><br/>
  Hymns which have never been heard, will inundate the earth.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  //Glory// to Christ, King for eternity, //Glory// to Christ,<br/><br/>
  His people will proclaim; Glory, Hallelujah,<br/><br/>
  His people will proclaim,<br/><br/>
  And His faithful believers, to glory He will take.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  For those of the chosen flock, they will not be confused,<br/><br/>
  Perpetually they'll be dwelling in the mansion of light;<br/><br/>
  There will be no cries and weeping, they will all disappear,<br/><br/>
  Forever in untold delight, with Christ they will rejoice.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Sorrowful hours of torment, try to weaken my soul,<br/><br/>
  A more divine sanctuary, with Jesus I will have;<br/><br/>
  The thorns that painfully pierce me, will no longer prevail,<br/><br/>
  Difficult trials won't matter, they won't opaque His love.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  My thirsty soul is desiring, more holiness Lord,<br/><br/>
  I want to follow the steep path of immortality;<br/><br/>
  With all the saints on that day, in your sweet presence be,<br/><br/>
In a spiritual concert, praising your pleasant name.</p></center>
