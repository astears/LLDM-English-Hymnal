<center><p>214 'TIS CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD<br/><br/>
  'Tis the Church of the living God,<br/><br/>
  Pillar and ground of truth;<br/><br/>
  Day and night she's been preparing,<br/><br/>
  For her Savior and her King,<br/><br/>
  Without blemish, stain, or wrinkle;<br/><br/>
  And with Christ someday she'll rise.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  The Lord's justice is apparent,<br/><br/>
  With the faithful of His flock;<br/><br/>
  If we walk always obeying,<br/><br/>
  Our dear Savior Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  In the kingdom of the heavens,<br/><br/>
  In the city of our God;<br/><br/>
  No one who defiles or lies,<br/><br/>
  Shall enter in the Lord's Kingdom;<br/><br/>
  For this reason, all His church,<br/><br/>
  Cleansing all, its heart and soul.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Oh you Church of the living God,<br/><br/>
  The pillar and ground of truth;<br/><br/>
  Like a torch your light burns on,<br/><br/>
  Through this dark and wicked world;<br/><br/>
  Walking onward in obedience,<br/><br/>
  Preaching humbleness and truth.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Jesus promised all His people,<br/><br/>
  To give them the crown of life;<br/><br/>
  His redeemed Church will receive it,<br/><br/>
  As it serves in holiness;<br/><br/>
  He awaits us in His glory,<br/><br/>
Where we will rejoice with Him.</p></center>
