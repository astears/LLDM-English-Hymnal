<center><p>554 YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SAW<br/><br/>
  You're the one who saw the Apostle John,<br/><br/>
  Flying about in the heavens;<br/><br/>
  With salvation for all the peoples.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  To every language, nation, and tribe,<br/><br/>
  Messenger, you angel, fly and announce, carrying the unction;<br/><br/>
  In this appointed time you are God's election,<br/><br/>
  From Zion the Lamb of God will come.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  For our salvation, honor we give you,<br/><br/>
  You have brought souls to the Lord's church;<br/><br/>
  When the work of God, was placed in our souls.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  You're the one who saw the Apostle John,<br/><br/>
  You brought to all peoples the blessing;<br/><br/>
A treasure so rich from the Lord's word.</p></center>
