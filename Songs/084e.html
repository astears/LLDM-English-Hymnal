<center><p>084 JUST AS TIRZAH YOU'RE DESIRED<br/><br/>
  Just as Tirzah you're desired,<br/><br/>
  Just as Jerusalem, so majestic;<br/><br/>
  As troops marching with their banners, is the lovely church of God.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  No matter if waves rise up high they will never put out,<br/><br/>
  His love nor will the rivers;<br/><br/>
  Not one man can give of all his treasury,<br/><br/>
  To buy the love that Jesus gives.<br/><br/>
  Certainly he cannot comprehend,<br/><br/>
  Because the love of Jesus Christ our Lord;<br/><br/>
  Will take us to mount Zion: place of God.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Your words flow like milk and honey,<br/><br/>
  You holy wife of Christ, who is faithful;<br/><br/>
  From your vestments pleasant odors, are of saffron and of myrrh.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Oh how beautiful the feet,<br/><br/>
  Which have been covered with the Evangel;<br/><br/>
  Work of our Teacher, the Master, Jesus Christ the most fair judge.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  You are she that's always growing,<br/><br/>
  Just as the dawning that is arising;<br/><br/>
With a beauty as the moonlight, shining as the sun above.</p></center>
