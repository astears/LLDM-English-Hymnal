<center><p>287 OH JESUS MY KING AND MY SOVEREIGN<br/><br/>
  Oh Jesus my King and my sovereign,<br/><br/>
  My joy is to sing him his praise;<br/><br/>
  He's King yet He treats me like family,<br/><br/>
  He's King yet He shares all His love.<br/><br/>
  Having from the Father all glory,<br/><br/>
  He came to lift me from the scoria;<br/><br/>
  //And now I rejoice// with Him.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Jesus is the friend that I long for,<br/><br/>
  In darkness and light always near;<br/><br/>
  Patient and humble always near me,<br/><br/>
  His help gives me comfort and cheer.<br/><br/>
  That's why I will faithfully follow,<br/><br/>
  Because He's my King and companion;<br/><br/>
  //And now I rejoice// with Him.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Oh Lord tell me what I could give you,<br/><br/>
  For all of your goodness to me?<br/><br/>
  Could this be enough, serve and love you?<br/><br/>
  And commit my whole life to thee?<br/><br/>
  If so then accept my devotion,<br/><br/>
  To you only now I surrender;<br/><br/>
//And now I rejoice// with Him.</p></center>
