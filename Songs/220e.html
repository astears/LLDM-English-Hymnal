<center><p>220 'TIS FROM HEAVEN<br/><br/>
  'Tis from heaven you were sanctified by God,<br/><br/>
  Not by man, but from the Lord your election came;<br/><br/>
  You're a fount that is flowing in the pathway,<br/><br/>
  Where the thirst of all sinners has been quenched.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  'Tis the glory that to Jacob was revealed,<br/><br/>
  Was passed on through the centuries amen;<br/><br/>
  We are reaping the joy from God's salvation,<br/><br/>
  All one body through our Lord Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Oh the promise dearest Jacob God gave you,<br/><br/>
  'Twas a promise bestowed unto you;<br/><br/>
  Your descendents will be like dust of the earth,<br/><br/>
  And forever be blessed by our Lord.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  If your language speaks of Jesus and His love,<br/><br/>
  If a gift He has bestowed on those He loved;<br/><br/>
  You have whispered mysterious in Jacob's dreams,<br/><br/>
In God's fear He deciphered the Lord's words.</p></center>
