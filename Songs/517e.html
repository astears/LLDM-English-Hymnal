<center><p>517 ONLY BY FAITH<br/><br/>
  Only by faith in Christ there's salvation,<br/><br/>
  And consolation the soul can feel;<br/><br/>
  Christ is the dawning, He is the morning,<br/><br/>
  That brings all mankind their salvation.<br/><br/>
  Search in the Bible and read His word,<br/><br/>
  Because it tells us the truth;<br/><br/>
  And you'll find that Jesus Christ came,<br/><br/>
  To give us our liberty.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Do not be despising the great message,<br/><br/>
  Open the doors that lead to your heart;<br/><br/>
  With a new robe you should be attired,<br/><br/>
  Leaving behind the corrupted robe.<br/><br/>
  Jesus Christ can even change your language,<br/><br/>
  If you serve Him truthfully;<br/><br/>
  And eternal life He gives you,<br/><br/>
  In the dwellings of the Lord.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Now is the time of the greatest promise,<br/><br/>
  That which my Savior has offered us;<br/><br/>
  He came to give us strength and endurance,<br/><br/>
  And then to guide His people in love.<br/><br/>
  Purity Christ gives to all His children,<br/><br/>
  And security as well;<br/><br/>
  He removes all of their sadness,<br/><br/>
  Glory to the name of God.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  In this world we are all very poor,<br/><br/>
  And persecuted with greatest fear;<br/><br/>
  All of the names are found up in heaven,<br/><br/>
  Of those who suffer for our Lord.<br/><br/>
  That's why Jesus wants the courageous,<br/><br/>
  If an effort they will make;<br/><br/>
  So that they may take His message,<br/><br/>
To a place it may be heard.</p></center>
