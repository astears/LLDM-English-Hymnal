<center><p>119 WHEN THE ROLL IS CALLED UP YONDER<br/><br/>
  When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound, and time shall be no more,<br/><br/>
  And the morning breaks, eternal, bright and fair;<br/><br/>
  When the saved of earth shall gather over on the other shore,<br/><br/>
  And the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  ///When the roll, is called up yonder///<br/><br/>
  When the roll is called up yonder I'll be there.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  On that bright and glorious morning when the dead in Christ arise,<br/><br/>
  And the glory of His resurrection share;<br/><br/>
  When His chosen ones shall gather to their home beyond the skies,<br/><br/>
  And the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Let us labor for the Master from the dawn till setting sun, Let us talk of all His<br/><br/>
  wondrous love and care; Then when all of life is over, and our work on earth is done,<br/><br/>
And the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.</p></center>
