<center><p>339 GLORIOUSLY MARCH OH YOU<br/><br/>
  Gloriously march oh you the youth,<br/><br/>
  Combat against the enemy;<br/><br/>
  Even though you might have to die for Christ your Lord,<br/><br/>
  Do not be frightened by your trials; <br/>
  When you preach of our Savior, Only our Lord is<br/><br/>
  able to save the lost souls.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Fight for Lord Jesus Christ,<br/><br/>
  Without fear, without fright;<br/><br/>
  Look at the ones without Jesus,<br/><br/>
  They walk without God, salvation too.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Of every member you will make,<br/><br/>
  As warrior with a strong heart;<br/><br/>
  Without fear to antagonize the enemy,<br/><br/>
  Let him know that Lord Jesus Christ;<br/><br/>
  He was a conqueror too,<br/><br/>
  Always with Him at His side we'll go marching on.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  When all the members of God's church,<br/><br/>
  Go out to work in God's field;<br/><br/>
  Full of God's spirit, full of grace, wisdom too,<br/><br/>
  So that with valor they will march;<br/><br/>
  Against all evilness and sin,<br/><br/>
Until we reach, victory of all the truth.</p></center>
