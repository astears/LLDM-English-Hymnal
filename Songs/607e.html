<center><p>607 MY SHEPHERD SUBLIME<br/><br/>
  My Shepherd sublime is Jesus,<br/><br/>
  He is at the right hand of our God;<br/><br/>
  His most subtle hand redeems me,<br/><br/>
  From all sins of the most vile man.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  My good Shepherd, your staff is guiding me,<br/><br/>
  My good Shepherd, with your love sustaining me;<br/><br/>
  My good Shepherd, nothing will my soul fear now,<br/><br/>
  Though through darkness I journey, the shadow of death;<br/><br/>
  I know with you, securely I'll walk.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  One day a sheep went a wandering,<br/><br/>
  And the Shepherd went looking for it;<br/><br/>
  Finding it well lost and captive,<br/><br/>
  For to save it He gave it His life.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  I have a Shepherd that's living,<br/><br/>
  In heaven, at right hand of God;<br/><br/>
  His pathway my sight does follow,<br/><br/>
  And His voice does direct all my ways.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Perhaps you are lost and wandering,<br/><br/>
  Without Pastor you're living, vile man;<br/><br/>
  If His loving voice, you hear now,<br/><br/>
Come and give all your heart and your soul.</p></center>
