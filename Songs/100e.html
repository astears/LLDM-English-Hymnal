<center><p>100 JESUS IN HIS MISSION<br/><br/>
  Jesus in his mission here on this earth,<br/><br/>
  One day with tears so sad in His soul, saw the city.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Oh //Jerusalem//, city of God,<br/><br/>
  I cry for you with all of my heart;<br/><br/>
  Just as birds care for all their young ones, I bring to you,<br/><br/>
  Salvation now to all of your souls.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Oh Jerusalem the beauteous who killed the prophets,<br/><br/>
  Servants and all those, God sent His people.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  As a hen who gathers all her children,<br/><br/>
  So is the Lord with all of His children: May He shield me.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  A bright shining church that has risen,<br/><br/>
  With one side injured, from spears of evil, from enemies.<br/><br/>
  5<br/><br/>
  He who is protected by Christ Jesus,<br/><br/>
Will be found ready, and go with Jesus, up to His home.</p></center>
