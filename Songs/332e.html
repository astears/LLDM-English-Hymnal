<center><p>332 THE TIMES ARE NOW AMONG US<br/><br/>
  The times are now among us, the days have been fulfilled,<br/><br/>
  Of all the prophecies that were given by the Lord;<br/><br/>
  As they left from the temple to the mount of the olives,<br/><br/>
  Along with words of wisdom, prophecies He told too.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  // As they left from the temple to the mount of the olives,<br/><br/>
  Along with words of wisdom, prophecies He told too//<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Today we see these new times are briefly passing by us,<br/><br/>
  And all the signs that tell us our Lord is coming back;<br/><br/>
  He speaks to us through the wars He speaks to us through the winds,<br/><br/>
  The time is coming closer when Jesus will return.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  All things have been fulfilled now, there's nothing else to wait for,<br/><br/>
  If anyone is sleeping it's time to be awake;<br/><br/>
  In Him well find the cure and faithful consolation,<br/><br/>
  The King of heaven will come to take his Church with Him.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Why wouldn't Jesus carry your sins and your transgressions?<br/><br/>
  For He has come to save us with His death on the cross;<br/><br/>
  He is your advocate and for you He's interceding,<br/><br/>
He wishes to redeem you as proof of His great love.</p></center>
