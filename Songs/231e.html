<center><p>231 THERE IS GREAT JOY<br/><br/>
  There is great joy and also contentment,<br/><br/>
  Engraved in my soul for my dear Lord;<br/><br/>
  //'Cause I remember that I have been saved,<br/><br/>
  Through the man chosen that God sent us//<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  In this day we commemorate blessings,<br/><br/>
  Of when our God had changed your name;<br/><br/>
  //Because you heard of this voice that told you:<br/><br/>
  Your new name will be Aaron//<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  A morning memorable and blessed,<br/><br/>
  Was when you heard the voice of the Lord;<br/><br/>
  //Today your children, we all remember,<br/><br/>
  So we are joyful in our Lord//<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  He suffered trials throughout His life time,<br/><br/>
  For having taught how to save our souls;<br/><br/>
  //But your God who has lift you up this day,<br/><br/>
Will always give you comfort and rest//</p></center>
