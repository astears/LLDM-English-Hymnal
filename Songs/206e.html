<center><p>206 I CHOSE LORD JESUS<br/><br/>
  I chose Lord Jesus when I am choosing the best,<br/><br/>
  He shows us the holy way and the most truthful path;<br/><br/>
  For that reason we are saying: That Jesus Christ is coming soon.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  He will lift up all the faithful on the earth,<br/><br/>
  At the end of their careers, through His glory they will pass;<br/><br/>
  In the great day of the Lord.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  In the path of Christ, let our steps march on behind,<br/><br/>
  Steps which He had marked when He had suffered for us;<br/><br/>
  And when Lord Jesus Christ comes down, all of His glory we'll see.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  The general Jesus, to the saints who praise His name,<br/><br/>
  He will guide and carry us to His celestial place;<br/><br/>
  We will be attributing praise when arriving in glory.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  There up in glory, when we're with Lord Jesus Christ,<br/><br/>
  Forever reigning with him, with the great Teacher and Lord;<br/><br/>
Never will we think of this world, no never think of it again.</p></center>
