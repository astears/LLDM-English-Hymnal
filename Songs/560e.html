<center><p>560 ONE DAY CHRIST WILL COME<br/><br/>
  One day Christ will come back to earth,<br/><br/>
  He promised when He rose above;<br/><br/>
  We will all see Him the same way,<br/><br/>
  And His people will see the King Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Yes very soon, Jesus will come,<br/><br/>
  And his people will gladly see Him;<br/><br/>
  We should always be watching and in prayer,<br/><br/>
  So that we may see Him that day.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  The Messengers sent by the Lord,<br/><br/>
  Confirm that Jesus will return;<br/><br/>
  So does the Spirit of our God,<br/><br/>
  In the Bible He has promised this to us.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Oh what glory without compare,<br/><br/>
  It will be when we see our King;<br/><br/>
  His beautiful face will outshine,<br/><br/>
  It will be an eclipse for the sun.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Oh welcome back King Jesus Christ,<br/><br/>
  Your church has been waiting for you;<br/><br/>
  Our faith will never be in vain,<br/><br/>
Our pleasure is Lord for you to return.</p></center>
