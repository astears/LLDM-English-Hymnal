<center><p>535 WHEN YOU LET SIN GUIDE<br/><br/>
  When you let sin guide your path you will sink your ship at sea,<br/><br/>
  You will be lost more and more in the vast sea;<br/><br/>
  The sea waves will carry your ship farther out from the shore,<br/><br/>
  You will be lost more and more in the vast sea.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  You'll be deviating more, more and more, in the vast and stormy sea,<br/><br/>
  You will deviate more, from our Father's love above;<br/><br/>
  And towards such a fatal death, You are deviating slowly more and more.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  When your light shines on the waters, you will note all of the dangers,<br/><br/>
  You are slowly deviating more and more;<br/><br/>
  There's a storm ahead of you, you are drifting from the dock,<br/><br/>
  You are deviating slowly more and more.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  All these voices in your soul who are calling you will cease,<br/><br/>
  You are slowly deviating more and more;<br/><br/>
  Oh my Brother, hear the voice, for only this voice saves you,<br/><br/>
  Before you go deviating more and more.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Don't you hear Christ calling you? He sees that you deviate,<br/><br/>
  You're in danger, a great danger more and more;<br/><br/>
  If in wandering you insist, He cannot come to your aid,<br/><br/>
And your death is coming closer more and more.</p></center>
