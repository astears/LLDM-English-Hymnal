<center><p>322 THE FIELDS FULL OF FLOWERS<br/><br/>
  The fields full of flowers are also adorned,<br/><br/>
  And you as those flowers adorn well your flock;<br/><br/>
  All your flock is happy to see you again,<br/><br/>
  Man who's been elected by Jesus my King.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Welcome now my Brother, oh Ambassador,<br/><br/>
  Announcing to the world, the message of love;<br/><br/>
  You're like Brother John, who also announced,<br/><br/>
  You have brought a doctrine, to save many souls.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  You march in front of the great battalion,<br/><br/>
  You conquer the whole earth, for our Lord above;<br/><br/>
  You as John the Baptist, announcing God's news,<br/><br/>
  To the soul who is lost and in error lives.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  More than sharpened arrow and as sweet honey,<br/><br/>
  These words for your people, which is God's flock;<br/><br/>
  All of your advice that you impart as well,<br/><br/>
  You instill great knowledge, comfort and courage.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  In this church of God there's a Man sent from God,<br/><br/>
  You as an Apostle are Servant of the Lord;<br/><br/>
  God's always provided a man who He's chose,<br/><br/>
Who may carry your flock, with Christ our Lord.</p></center>
