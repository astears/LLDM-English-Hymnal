<center><p>354 MY GOOD DOCTOR IS<br/><br/>
  My good doctor is the Lord Jesus Christ,<br/><br/>
  //He heals me// He takes every illness away from me;<br/><br/>
  And He comes to heal my entire being,<br/><br/>
  Oh how good is the Lord!<br/><br/>
  This is why I give Him praise.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  My Jesus can heal me, my soul and my body,<br/><br/>
  And He brings me His peace to comfort my heart.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  And my only best friend is Christ the King,<br/><br/>
  His love consoles me,<br/><br/>
  If I'm feeling sadness within my heart;<br/><br/>
  His love will support me and give me strength,<br/><br/>
  Oh how good is the Lord!<br/><br/>
  This is why I give Him praise.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  My good Pastor's guiding me faithfully,<br/><br/>
  I feel so secure now, He tells me that very soon I will be;<br/><br/>
  Up there in the brand new Jerusalem,<br/><br/>
Oh how good is the Lord!, this is why I give Him praise.</p></center>
