<center><p>007 I PRAISE THE LORD GOD<br/><br/>
  I praise the Lord God with my spirit, deep within my heart,<br/><br/>
  Because He has filled all my soul with, blissfulness and peace;<br/><br/>
  I'll sing, and I'll serve, and I'll praise Him, with solemnity,<br/><br/>
  Because He is guiding, my life and my footsteps, to eternity.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  All my soul sings to Jehovah,<br/><br/>
  Because in Him only, my soul has found peace;<br/><br/>
  I lift up, this song to Jehovah,<br/><br/>
  Because being holy, He made me holy.<br/><br/>
  For the Lord are all my sweet songs,<br/><br/>
  Which are full of dreams, with integrity;<br/><br/>
  So for Him I want to live,<br/><br/>
  Because He has promised to dwell in me.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Rejoicing I walk in the pathway, because I'm with God,<br/><br/>
  By faith I can see in the heavens, His beautiful home;<br/><br/>
  I hear by my side that His voice, comes to comfort me,<br/><br/>
  And blissful and joyous, I see His great glory, deep within my heart.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  The young soul who walks insecurely, to eternity,<br/><br/>
  In God he will find self-assurance, and security;<br/><br/>
  Because He wants to save all the souls, in their youthfulness,<br/><br/>
And yes He can save them, if they come to Jesus, with solicitude.</p></center>
