<center><p>594 IN THAT DAY<br/><br/>
  In that day you will say:<br/><br/>
  &quot;I will praise you, oh Lord,<br/><br/>
  Although you were angry with me, your anger has turned away;<br/><br/>
  And you have comforted me,<br/><br/>
  Surely God is my salvation,<br/><br/>
  I will trust and not be afraid.<br/><br/>
  The Lord, the Lord, is my strength and my song,<br/><br/>
  He has become my salvation;&quot;<br/><br/>
  With joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation,<br/><br/>
  In that day you will say:<br/><br/>
  &quot;Give thanks to the Lord, call on his name;<br/><br/>
  Make known among the nations what he has done,<br/><br/>
  And proclaim that his name is exalted.<br/><br/>
  •••••<br/><br/>
  //Sing to the Lord// For he has done glorious things;<br/><br/>
  Let this be known to all the world,<br/><br/>
  Shout aloud and sing for joy, people of Zion;<br/><br/>
  For great is the Holy One of Israel among you.<br/><br/>
  With joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation,<br/><br/>
  In that day you will say:<br/><br/>
  &quot;Give thanks to the Lord, call on his name;<br/><br/>
  Make known among the nations what he has done,<br/><br/>
And proclaim that his name is exalted.</p></center>
