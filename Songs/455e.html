<center><p>455 WHO IS THIS<br/><br/>
  Who is this who appears just as the dawning,<br/><br/>
  Beautiful as the moon and, shining clearly as the sun;<br/><br/>
  So impressive just like soldiers all in order,<br/><br/>
  This is the church of the Lord.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  //Hallelujah// to Jehovah King,<br/><br/>
  Always walking ahead of us;<br/><br/>
  Glory to God up in the heavens, and on earth be peace,<br/><br/>
  To all wise men with their spirits of good will.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Oh leave all you virgins and go, from Zion to see Solomon,<br/><br/>
  With a golden crown that was placed on His head;<br/><br/>
  The joyful day of delight in his heart,<br/><br/>
  This is my King, Jesus Christ my Lord.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Who is this that arises from the desert,<br/><br/>
  Swiftly as the smoke arises, it's the church of Jesus Christ;<br/><br/>
  It was purchased with the blood of Jesus Christ,<br/><br/>
  We're hoping always for Christ.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  This is the church of the Lord, once in the desert,<br/><br/>
  By the words of our Father, up in heaven watching down;<br/><br/>
  Now Christ Jesus made it shine just as the sun shines,<br/><br/>
Come you who sins to Jesus Christ.</p></center>
