<center><p>280 JERUSALEM CITY OF GOD<br/><br/>
  Jerusalem, city of God,<br/><br/>
  Beautiful place, flowing with love;<br/><br/>
  Glorious Eden, flowing with light,<br/><br/>
  Full of all peace, and glories too;<br/><br/>
  It will descend from heights of our Go,<br/><br/>
  Just like a wife dressed with beauty she'll come.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Construction that's unshakeable,<br/><br/>
  Is the city of our King;<br/><br/>
  The precious stones of jasper are,<br/><br/>
  Resplendent as the sun above;<br/><br/>
  Twelve doors are open for all they who search,<br/><br/>
  And at each door an angel stands guard.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  The clarity and light of God,<br/><br/>
  There is in you great holiness;<br/><br/>
  In order to forever shine,<br/><br/>
  In day and night without an end;<br/><br/>
  Nor sun or moon light will illuminate,<br/><br/>
  Jesus the Savior, our light he will be.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  To live in you will be my joy,<br/><br/>
  Having our God as our king;<br/><br/>
  Were death can never penetrate,<br/><br/>
  And then in peace we'll always live;<br/><br/>
  There'll be no suffering, nor crying nor pain,<br/><br/>
  Our Jesus Christ will be everything.<br/><br/>
  5<br/><br/>
  Jerusalem, a new city,<br/><br/>
  The sanctity does reign in you;<br/><br/>
  The one who's vile, speaks many lies,<br/><br/>
  Has not a chance, to enter there;<br/><br/>
  Only the ones who are just and are true,<br/><br/>
Their names are written in the book of God.</p></center>
