<center><p>575 I CAME TO CHRIST<br/><br/>
  I came to Christ and by grace He did saved,<br/><br/>
  I took the cross of the blessed Savior Lord;<br/><br/>
  And now all I need is your help to persevere,<br/><br/>
  May I always also restrain my tongue.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  All this world can offer mankind, is perdition for His soul,<br/><br/>
  Salvation our Lord Jesus Christ will offer to us;<br/><br/>
  Sustain my soul oh Lord, do not ever let it perish,<br/><br/>
  And help me so that I may see your face one day.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  There is a God and a Mediator too,<br/><br/>
  Who takes away our evil and our sins;<br/><br/>
  He came to save me from the depths of sin,<br/><br/>
  And so I follow the only path of truth.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  There's a commandment that our Savior left for us,<br/><br/>
  And with the help of the Lord we must comply;<br/><br/>
  He asked us to pray for one another always,<br/><br/>
  So that the Lord may clean His people from all sin.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Take away from me all quarrels and all rage,<br/><br/>
  Every dissension, and every imperfection;<br/><br/>
  And may you clean my heart every day Lord,<br/><br/>
Allow me to love all my brothers equally.</p></center>
