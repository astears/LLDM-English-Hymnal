<center><p>346 I FEEL VERY CONTENT<br/><br/>
  I feel very content, just like the very first time that I heard,<br/><br/>
  The sweet voice of my God, glory to Him;<br/><br/>
  When I was told of my Jesus,<br/><br/>
  I heard of the word they were preaching,<br/><br/>
  That there's a man of God.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  I rejoice in my dear Lord, glory hallelujah to God,<br/><br/>
  Let us open our lips my Brothers;<br/><br/>
  Let us shout with greatest rejoicing,<br/><br/>
  That there's a man of God.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  So that is why today, my breath will not be enough to confess,<br/><br/>
  There is a man of God, here in this place;<br/><br/>
  That is why we're all reunited, to the living God we are singing,<br/><br/>
  In order to serve Him.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  We have come here today, we want to serve you oh our God,<br/><br/>
  As we bring unto you, with all our hearts;<br/><br/>
  A most humble and holy present, receive it today in your hands Lord;<br/><br/>
  Oh blessed Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Just as we tend to see, the waters running clearly through the streams,<br/><br/>
  As so the souls will come, here to this place;<br/><br/>
  From eastern and the western nations, many people will come running,<br/><br/>
To see Him they will come.</p></center>
