<center><p>348 GOOD JESUS CHRIST<br/><br/>
  Good Jesus Christ, my Lord, I wish to serve thee,<br/><br/>
  And in your vineyard I would like to work;<br/><br/>
  I will be happy just being at your service,<br/><br/>
  Throughout this whole world is where I'd like to work.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  And when my life is over on this earth Lord,<br/><br/>
  Grant me one wish to one day reach your dwelling;<br/><br/>
  My clean and pure soul I am wishing to give you,<br/><br/>
  Oh Lord I want you to crown me on that day.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Good Jesus Christ, my Lord, I wish to serve thee,<br/><br/>
  With all the virtues of spirit and of pow'r;<br/><br/>
  Working with miracles through your holy gospel,<br/><br/>
  Giving believers eternal life and joy.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Good Jesus Christ, my Lord, I wish to serve thee,<br/><br/>
  And in your vineyard I would like to work;<br/><br/>
  Before my soul makes its way to paradise,<br/><br/>
Lord I want to take advantage of my time.</p></center>
