<center><p>240 ARE YOU WASHED IN THE BLOOD<br/><br/>
  Have you been to Jesus for the cleansing power?<br/><br/>
  Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?<br/><br/>
  Are you fully trusting in His grace this hour?<br/><br/>
  Are you washed in the blood of the lamb?<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Are you washed in the blood?<br/><br/>
  In the soul cleansing blood of the Lamb;<br/><br/>
  Are your garments spotless?<br/><br/>
  Are they white as snow?<br/><br/>
  Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Are you walking daily by the Savior's side?<br/><br/>
  Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?<br/><br/>
  Do you rest each moment in the crucified?<br/><br/>
  Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  When the Bride-groom cometh will your robes be white?<br/><br/>
  Pure and white in the blood of the Lamb?<br/><br/>
  Will your souls be ready for the mansions bright?<br/><br/>
  And be washed in the blood of the Lamb?<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Lay aside the garments that are stained with sin,<br/><br/>
  And be washed in the blood of the Lamb;<br/><br/>
  There's a fountain flowing for the soul unclean,<br/><br/>
Oh be washed in the blood of the Lamb.</p></center>
