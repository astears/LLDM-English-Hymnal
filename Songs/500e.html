<center><p>500 OH YOU SERVANTS OF THE LORD<br/><br/>
  Oh you servants of the Lord, bring to the storage house,<br/><br/>
  There's great abundance of aliment,<br/><br/>
  //The Lord Jehovah has said//<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  God will send blessings to the liberal servant with joy,<br/><br/>
  Showers of grace and of love, from the throne of His mansion.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  I'll bring an offering of heart, for the work of God to spread,<br/><br/>
  Rewards from heaven He'll give me,<br/><br/>
  //Said Christ my Savior and Lord//<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  He who in blessing has sown, in blessing he'll also reap,<br/><br/>
  He who has sown so scarcely,<br/><br/>
  //So scarcely he will reap//<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  The rich are mimicking those, who gave only out of wealth,<br/><br/>
  Without their hearts, but the widow, gave with all her heart and soul;<br/><br/>
Two coins, that is all she owned.</p></center>
