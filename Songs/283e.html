<center><p>283 JESUS CHRIST TO EARTH WILL COME<br/><br/>
  Jesus Christ to earth will come again,<br/><br/>
  He has promised us,<br/><br/>
  To pick up all His faithful church, that He has redeemed.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Oh//what sweet peace//that Christ Jesus has put in my soul,<br/><br/>
  Oh//what sweet peace//I'm not able to grasp;<br/><br/>
  Oh what sweet peace, that Christ put in my being,<br/><br/>
  Hallelujah to Him for His kindness!<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  In the service of Jesus Christ,<br/><br/>
  I feel so comforted, In the service of the Lord,<br/><br/>
  I do find much peace.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  In the service of Jesus Christ, one encounters the truth,<br/><br/>
  From the instructions of my Lord, one encounters peace.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  In the doctrine of my dear Lord, my faith is affirmed,<br/><br/>
  From the instructions of my Lord, my faith does persist.<br/><br/>
  5<br/><br/>
  In the church of Lord Jesus Christ, freedom I have,<br/><br/>
From the instructions of my Lord, with love I do sing.</p></center>
