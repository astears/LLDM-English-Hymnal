<center><p>600 I HAVE FOUND A FAITHFUL FRIEND<br/><br/>
  I have found a faithful friend His name is Jesus,<br/><br/>
  More than Father, Mother, Brother, He;<br/><br/>
  More than silver, more than gold, and more than copper,<br/><br/>
  Of all peoples Jesus Christ is your best friend.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  //If I've Jesus, Jesus only,<br/><br/>
  I have everything I need,<br/><br/>
  He is my Friend//<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  He's a rose from Sharon giving off sweet fragrance,<br/><br/>
  And the lily of the valley, He;<br/><br/>
  For the soul who is so sad and in affliction,<br/><br/>
  He exhales the sweetest perfume full of love.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  He's compassionate, benign, tender, and loving,<br/><br/>
  He is slow to anger, quick in love;<br/><br/>
  With His love He raises up all broken-hearted,<br/><br/>
Christ is the only one who knows how to love.</p></center>
