<center><p>136 SWEETER AS THE YEARS GO BY<br/><br/>
  Of Jesus' love that sought me, when I was lost in sin,<br/><br/>
  Of wondrous grace that brought me back from His fold again;<br/><br/>
  Of heights and depths of mercy, far deeper than the sea,<br/><br/>
  And higher than the heavens, my theme shall ever be.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  //Sweeter as the years go by//<br/><br/>
  Richer, fuller, deeper,<br/><br/>
  Jesus' love is sweeter;<br/><br/>
  Sweeter as the years go by.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  He trod in old Judea, life's pathway long ago,<br/><br/>
  The people thronged about Him, His saving grace to know;<br/><br/>
  He healed the broken hearted, and caused the blind to see,<br/><br/>
  And still His great heart yearneth in love for even me.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  'Twas wondrous love which led Him for us to suffer loss,<br/><br/>
  To bear without a murmur the anguish of the cross;<br/><br/>
  With saints redeemed in glory, let us our voices raise,<br/><br/>
  Till heav'n and earth re-echo with our redeemer's praise.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  His love through all the ages, a beacon of the world,<br/><br/>
  That guides us in our pathway, to heaven up above;<br/><br/>
  As time goes by and by, His love beyond compare,<br/><br/>
Most precious to the soul, eternal peace He brings.</p></center>
