<center><p>520 WE ARE STRONG SOLDIERS OF THE WAR<br/><br/>
  We are strong soldiers of the war, with triumph we'll viciously fight,<br/><br/>
  With the sword full of God's faith, against the world of evilness;<br/><br/>
  Nothing will harm us as we fight, Christ Jesus will be our Captain,<br/><br/>
  In His name there is much power, to fight Satan well and clear.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  All the fighting here will end, and there will be peace,<br/><br/>
  We'll be sitting on the shore, and be resting there;<br/><br/>
  All those in the battle faithfully fighting Lord,<br/><br/>
  A prize in the end they'll have, of Jesus their Lord.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  With the shield of faith in hand, the darts of evil cannot strike,<br/><br/>
  Because to all the sinners here, God will provide us with a shield;<br/><br/>
  If in obedience we walk, and always guard His laws of love,<br/><br/>
  He has promised us the victory, each and every day, praise Him.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  If you feel weak when you go fight, and feel your strength is coming down,<br/><br/>
  Jesus is offering you the strength, the victory and valor too;<br/><br/>
  After with songs of praise to Him, against the spirits we will fight,<br/><br/>
Rescuing souls from all their evil, they who walk in all their sins.</p></center>
