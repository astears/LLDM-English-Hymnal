<center><p>169 THE KING OF GLORY<br/><br/>
  The King of glory is now calling,<br/><br/>
  Humanity to salvation;<br/><br/>
  All of His blessing He's now shedding,<br/><br/>
  For plenty health and holiness.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Oh come to the King Jesus Christ,<br/><br/>
  The one who died to give us light, salvation too.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  All of you souls who are lost in this world,<br/><br/>
  Who are now longing liberty;<br/><br/>
  The King of glory now awaits thee,<br/><br/>
  So that you taste His goodness too.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  God with His word is calling mankind,<br/><br/>
  They should obey in holiness;<br/><br/>
  And being baptized in His great Name,<br/><br/>
  And purified in His great word.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Christ is the pathway for all mankind,<br/><br/>
  He is the truth He is our life;<br/><br/>
  Eternal father and divine love,<br/><br/>
Through everlasting times to come.</p></center>
