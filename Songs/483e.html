<center><p>483 ALL THROUGHOUT EGYPT<br/><br/>
  All throughout Egypt I wandered along,<br/><br/>
  Through many fennels, I aguishly walked;<br/><br/>
  I was fatigued from this path of mistakes,<br/><br/>
  My good Pastor had looked for me.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Great land that caused embezzlement,<br/><br/>
  A mystical path that my soul found one day;<br/><br/>
  Egypt the great, attractive with lust,<br/><br/>
  Full of enchantments which ruin my soul.<br/><br/>
  Just as a lion devouring me,<br/><br/>
  'Twas in the sepulcher my heart was found;<br/><br/>
  In the perdition, my soul was so lost,<br/><br/>
  Egypt the great leads to our death.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  My Savior has gave salvation to me,<br/><br/>
  In all your Servants my soul finds rest;<br/><br/>
  I was fatigued from this path of mistakes,<br/><br/>
  My good Pastor had looked for me.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  One day oh Egypt, you'll pay for your sins,<br/><br/>
  All your attraction deserves punishment;<br/><br/>
  All fascinations and vanities too,<br/><br/>
The Lord Christ will abhor your pleas.</p></center>
