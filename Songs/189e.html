<center><p>189 IN THE DARKNESS<br/><br/>
  In times of darkness God's light had triumphed through,<br/><br/>
  With all its brightness, it gleamed and glistened my heart;<br/><br/>
  And without fear I am walking over hardships,<br/><br/>
  And through His word I envision victory.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  All the people agonized by darkness, saw the light,<br/><br/>
  All the people who despaired and were hopeless in sin;<br/><br/>
  His light helped them clearly see, that Christ had taken from their life, all the strife,<br/><br/>
  From anguishing darkness God rescued me.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Be lifted up, Jesus Christ has come to us,<br/><br/>
  He is the light who will glisten our hearts and souls;<br/><br/>
  And you will shine like the dawning of the morning,<br/><br/>
  And you will radiate further than the sun.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  During creation great light was formed by God,<br/><br/>
  The sun and moon: luminaries,<br/><br/>
  He placed on earth; And an Apostle to save most vile sinners,<br/><br/>
During one time, I among them had once lived.</p></center>
