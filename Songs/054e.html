<center><p>054 AS CLAY IN YOUR HANDS<br/><br/>
  //As clay in your hands, I want to be//<br/><br/>
  And if you want it, you may now mold me;<br/><br/>
  And in your own way, that's why I came here,<br/><br/>
  To be with you.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  So if I'm living, for Him I'm living,<br/><br/>
  And if I'm dying, for Him I'm dying;<br/><br/>
  If it be living, or that we die here,<br/><br/>
  ////We belong to Him////<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  //Vessel of honor, I want to be//<br/><br/>
  And if you want it, you may now mold me;<br/><br/>
  And in your own way, that's why I came here,<br/><br/>
  To be with you.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Each lovely morning, your Servant prays,<br/><br/>
  His voice is lifted, to you dear Lord;<br/><br/>
  Each new beginning, of everyday,<br/><br/>
  //That I be faithful//<br/><br/>
In serving you.</p></center>
