<center><p>578 I LIVED WITHOUT PEACE<br/><br/>
  I lived without peace on earth,<br/><br/>
  Without hope and without God;<br/><br/>
  Until one blessed evening, I came close to my Christ.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  He has erased all my wickedness,<br/><br/>
  He will not take account of my sin;<br/><br/>
  As holy as He is, He has redeemed me,<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  With Christ I found holy peace.<br/><br/>
  He has changed all of my life,<br/><br/>
  He is the rock eternal;<br/><br/>
  My tender Savior Christ.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  He calls the sinners to Him,<br/><br/>
  He wants no evil for them;<br/><br/>
  For them He suffered death,<br/><br/>
To forgive them their sins.</p></center>
