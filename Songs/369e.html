<center><p>369 OUR LORD IS VERY CLOSE<br/><br/>
  Our Lord is very close to us,<br/><br/>
  He is our only God and Lord;<br/><br/>
  He is the only one who saves,<br/><br/>
  All men from their dark load of sin.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  //The Lord is always very near,<br/><br/>
  He will endure all of our pain//<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  The faithful people of the Lord,<br/><br/>
  They will have holy peace and light;<br/><br/>
  The enemy they will defeat,<br/><br/>
  As snow he'll melt away from us.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Souls living in captivity,<br/><br/>
  They will have liberty through Christ;<br/><br/>
  Dark shadows will surround those men,<br/><br/>
  Full of ungodliness and sin.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  The evil servants of satan,<br/><br/>
  They will not have peace on this earth;<br/><br/>
  Only the saints of Christ will have,<br/><br/>
  Triumphs and victory while they live.<br/><br/>
  5<br/><br/>
  The faithful will see His good face,<br/><br/>
  And perfect holiness they'll gain;<br/><br/>
  Oh Christ give me of your great pow'r,<br/><br/>
Only your good will I will do.</p></center>
