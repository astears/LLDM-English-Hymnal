<center><p>153 COUNS'LING SWEET MOMENTS<br/><br/>
  Couns'ling sweet moments, I've passed on my cross,<br/><br/>
  Those which I have passed, close to you Christ;<br/><br/>
  There's so much suffering, agony so painful,<br/><br/>
  Looking to Jesus, the Lamb of God.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Look how His arms are, upraised and open,<br/><br/>
  His arms inviting to go with Him;<br/><br/>
  Making as His own, all of my errors,<br/><br/>
  For me His lips don't mind bitter herbs.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Flowing's a fountain, from Jesus's wounds,<br/><br/>
  Blood I see flowing, from all His veins;<br/><br/>
  Sprinkling on my head, impure unholy,<br/><br/>
  My childish faults He, managed to erase.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Look at His anguish, how it has perished,<br/><br/>
  Offering is now done, of penitence;<br/><br/>
  His noble forehead lowly and inclined,<br/><br/>
  Redemption for souls, Jesus gave us.<br/><br/>
  5<br/><br/>
  Moments so charming, rich in His blessings,<br/><br/>
  Of peace and grace and, of life and light;<br/><br/>
  Only there's comfort, and many blessings,<br/><br/>
Close to Christ Jesus, close to His cross.</p></center>
