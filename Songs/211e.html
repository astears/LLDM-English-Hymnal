<center><p>211 BE ON ALERT<br/><br/>
  Be on alert, oh people of the Lord,<br/><br/>
  'Cause in this world things are coming to an end;<br/><br/>
  The men who Jesus Christ said would come to preach,<br/><br/>
  Using His name many people will be tricked.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  ///Watch and be praying Christ will come/// J<br/><br/>
  esus my king, soon will return to earth.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Kingdoms and nations are fighting without cease,<br/><br/>
  Tornados, hunger is present on the earth;<br/><br/>
  They only confirm what Jesus Christ has said,<br/><br/>
  For none of His words will ever pass away.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Until the end all the wickedness will grow,<br/><br/>
  Making the love of His people grow cold;<br/><br/>
  But he who will persevere until the end,<br/><br/>
  Jesus has said: It is he who will be saved.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Christ signs of coming are now being fulfilled,<br/><br/>
  It's word for word written as the Bible tells;<br/><br/>
  All of the peoples perplexed by what they see,<br/><br/>
And they are saying, oh what will happen next!</p></center>
