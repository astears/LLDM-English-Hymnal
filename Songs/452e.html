  Who is like you my God?<br/><br/>
  Among all other Gods,<br/><br/>
  Who is like you? Magnificent, so holy;<br/><br/>
  Awful in praises, worker of many miracles,<br/><br/>
  Your right hand oh my God, wonderful things it has done;<br/><br/>
  Your mighty right hand is your strength oh my Lord,<br/><br/>
  It's broke in pieces all our cruel enemies.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Jehovah, God of battle, Jehovah is His name,<br/><br/>
  Jehovah is all of my strength and joyful song;<br/><br/>
  He has given me health, this is my God,<br/><br/>
  And I will exalt well His name;<br/><br/>
  //God of my fathers, to Him I will give praise//<br/><br/>
Jehovah, God of battle, Jehovah is His name.</p></center>
