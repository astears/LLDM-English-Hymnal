<center><p>159 THE HOLY SPIRIT<br/><br/>
  The Holy Spirit is being conveyed and is shedding,<br/><br/>
  Among us in this church;<br/><br/>
  Blessings coming from heaven are now contemplated,<br/><br/>
  Just like early showers.<br/><br/>
  The brothers are preaching,<br/><br/>
  They speak things from heaven they're singing and crying;<br/><br/>
  It's a feast from the heavens it's the one that we're seeing,<br/><br/>
  Like that day at Pentecost, oh glorious day.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  If we ask for the Unction of the most high God,<br/><br/>
  We will be rejoicing; It is the Holy Spirit, who will fill our lives here,<br/><br/>
  With ineffable joy. Precious gifts will be given,<br/><br/>
  And a feast we will have as we sing Hallelujahs;<br/><br/>
  All the sick will be healed as they lay hands over them,<br/><br/>
  Because God is the same now and forever more.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  When Christ comes back descending, with great might and power,<br/><br/>
  We will see His glory;<br/><br/>
  All the stars will be singing, the heavens, the oceans,<br/><br/>
  The rivers and the mountains. In the whole universe our eyes will be watching,<br/><br/>
  The glory of Jesus; In that glorious day when Jesus Christ will descend,<br/><br/>
For He will come back to take all His children there.</p></center>
