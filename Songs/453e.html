<center><p>453 WHO IS THE ONE<br/><br/>
  Who is the one who is humble and contrite,<br/><br/>
  And comes to Jesus asking for helping hand?<br/><br/>
  Who is the one who embarrasses themselves,<br/><br/>
  And doesn't receive an answer to all their prayers?<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  //Who is the one?//<br/><br/>
  Who comes to me, yes to me with all their heart?<br/><br/>
  //Who is the one?//<br/><br/>
  Who doesn't receive what they are asking in prayer?<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Jesus has said: ask, and I shall give to you,<br/><br/>
  All the petitions that your heart will have;<br/><br/>
  And when you knock I will also open up,<br/><br/>
  So I can crown you with my holy blessings too.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Don't ever tire when praying to your Lord,<br/><br/>
  If something's missing, demand of it with faith;<br/><br/>
  For Jesus Christ in His love that's never ending,<br/><br/>
  Has left a promise saying: ask, and I will give.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Who is the one who is asking for forgiveness,<br/><br/>
  And I reject Him because of all their sins?<br/><br/>
  You should know that I have come to give salvation,<br/><br/>
Come to me quickly and you will have salvation.</p></center>
