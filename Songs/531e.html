<center><p>531 THE TRUMPETS ARE SOUNDING<br/><br/>
  The trumpets are sounding in the highest heaven,<br/><br/>
  And the multitudes are singing songs of joy;<br/><br/>
  It's 'cause they are passing all those who are valiant,<br/><br/>
  Who on earth have loved, Jesus Christ their Lord.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  No, //never no// don't ever separate me,<br/><br/>
  No, //never no// never should I leave Him;<br/><br/>
  Your great love you had shown me, when He came to save my soul,<br/><br/>
  No, //never no// never should I, be far away from Him.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Prudent virgins are those, members of the Lord's church,<br/><br/>
  Of Christ Jesus Savior, the most good Pastor;<br/><br/>
  He that has the oil, and a lamp ascended,<br/><br/>
  Because he is waiting for his Savior king.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Others who are weary walk with tears of sadness,<br/><br/>
  Because they are feeling a great bitter pain;<br/><br/>
  Because the divine judge, with a flaming finger,<br/><br/>
  Has denied them entrance to the His place above.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Which are you my brother? Of those who are joyful,<br/><br/>
  Or of those who suffer separation here;<br/><br/>
  If you like rejoicing, stand up tall, be fighting,<br/><br/>
Diligently working to save your dear soul.</p></center>
