<center><p>327 THE CENTURIES HAVE PASSED<br/><br/>
  The centuries have passed and prophecies fulfilled,<br/><br/>
  And the tree of life flourished and gave fruit;<br/><br/>
  The same God who took the tree of life from Eden,<br/><br/>
  He took just a branch, only just a vine shoot;<br/><br/>
  And the Lord gave virtue, to Aaron's staff.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  The virtue was given a mark,<br/><br/>
  Of life eternal, once man has died;<br/><br/>
  Branch of Aaron, from God of love,<br/><br/>
  Within this country has come to bloom.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Take note to when God said,<br/><br/>
  The God of goodness,<br/><br/>
  Every soul that I love no one takes away;<br/><br/>
  As much as the tempests move the evil winds,<br/><br/>
  I have conquered this world; this world is not able;<br/><br/>
  To take from any souls from my hands they are mine.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Come soul who is thirsty, leave all of your pain,<br/><br/>
  What beautiful virtues and marvels you see;<br/><br/>
  Cause up in the heavens, where the Lord reigns,<br/><br/>
  He disperses virtues and gifts to his children;<br/><br/>
  And all of his power to Christ he has gave.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  The branch of that great tree came to Emmanuel,<br/><br/>
  And to the anointed of the new Israel;<br/><br/>
  The date has been branded it's to be remembered,<br/><br/>
  The ages have gone by, that from our fathers;<br/><br/>
The great branch of Aaron has been delivered.</p></center>
