<center><p>058 RAINS OF BLESSINGS<br/><br/>
  Rains of blessings of sanctity and love,<br/><br/>
  Joyfully unite together, with all the saints of the Lord;<br/><br/>
  Because on this day the Servants of God have arrived.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Welcome we give to the messengers of our God,<br/><br/>
  Who come with love this day, to proclaim His praise;<br/><br/>
  The church welcomes the chosen men, whom God has anointed,<br/><br/>
  To those who are elected, by Lord Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  God's church overflows with love on this day,<br/><br/>
  You Servants of the high God, are saluting everyone;<br/><br/>
  We are tasting God's communion, and His sanctity.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  In this congregation we receive God's love,<br/><br/>
  We are lifting up our songs, for as one we sing to God;<br/><br/>
He's the one who has received them, with honor and love.</p></center>
