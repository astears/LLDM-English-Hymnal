<center><p>386 OH JESUS BELOVED<br/><br/>
  Oh Jesus beloved, my blessed savior Lord,<br/><br/>
  For you I have left all of my pathways of error;<br/><br/>
  I want to serve you, because you have loved my soul,<br/><br/>
  ///Once I did not love you/// but Lord I do so now.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Arriving to the heavens, these words I'll surely sing,<br/><br/>
  ///I was vile, unworthy/// but Jesus has saved me.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  I love you oh Christ, because in your endless love,<br/><br/>
  You took the defilements, embarrassment, and pain;<br/><br/>
  Crown of thorns and needles, you wore for me Jesus,<br/><br/>
  ///Once I did not love you/// but Lord I do so now.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  In life and in death I will always love you Lord,<br/><br/>
  And with songs of glory my voice will sing your praise;<br/><br/>
  Because on a cross you died for me oh Jesus,<br/><br/>
  ///Once I did not love you/// but Lord I do so now.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  In holy sweet dwellings of everlasting joy,<br/><br/>
  To Christ Jesus the Lamb, forever immortal;<br/><br/>
  Forever I'll sing, what joy will be for me!<br/><br/>
///Once I did not love you/// but Lord I do so now.</p></center>
