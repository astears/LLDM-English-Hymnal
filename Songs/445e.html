<center><p>445 WHAT IS PRAYER?<br/><br/>
  What is a prayer? Science from the Comforter,<br/><br/>
  What science is this? Secretive, mysterious;<br/><br/>
  Mysterious because it is spiritual,<br/><br/>
  It is a secret, for it's not seen.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Oh, sweet hour of prayer,<br/><br/>
  Through you I speak with my highest God;<br/><br/>
  When I kneel down I receive many blessings,<br/><br/>
  And I am called a child of our God.<br/><br/>
  Only through you, I gain many blessings,<br/><br/>
  Through you I'm always delighted;<br/><br/>
  And through you, I will have comfort.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  And through a prayer, God's servant Jacob prevailed,<br/><br/>
  When in Bethel, He was fighting along with God;<br/><br/>
  He did not let go until God had blessed him,<br/><br/>
  He only won, because of His prayer.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  And through a prayer, from prison Daniel was freed,<br/><br/>
  And through a prayer, Jonas's life had been spared too;<br/><br/>
  And this was not through their strength nor themselves,<br/><br/>
  Only through prayer, God had heard them.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  This is why our Lord, had left His teaching behind,<br/><br/>
  It's necessary, to pray to God so we don't faint;<br/><br/>
  'Cause through a prayer, we'll gain strength for the fight,<br/><br/>
Through our prayer, we will live with Him.</p></center>
