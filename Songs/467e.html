<center><p>467 I WANT TO LIVE<br/><br/>
  I want to live with my celestial King,<br/><br/>
  Up there in that precious city of light;<br/><br/>
  Where all the saints can be heard giving praises,<br/><br/>
  They worship Jesus eternally there.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  //I want to live// with my King,<br/><br/>
  In that beautiful city of light.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  No one in this world is able to find,<br/><br/>
  Eternal happiness eternal peace;<br/><br/>
  Only the souls who have been here so faithful,<br/><br/>
  Only they'll live with the celestial King.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Up there in heaven we can hear the songs,<br/><br/>
  Of all the souls who have gone to rejoice;<br/><br/>
  That's why I wish to leave this life behind me,<br/><br/>
  So that one day I may live with my King.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  There's many souls who are living up there,<br/><br/>
  From our church, in that city they live;<br/><br/>
  These are the souls who worked justice and truth here,<br/><br/>
This is the reason they're now with my King.</p></center>
