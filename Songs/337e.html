<center><p>337 MARCH ON WITH JOY<br/><br/>
  March on with joy oh people of the Lord,<br/><br/>
  Praising and singing our glories to our God;<br/><br/>
  It is Jesus who lovingly invites us,<br/><br/>
  To come and join him in this banquet made with love.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  God had predestined His church before creation,<br/><br/>
  And once His people had been scattered through the world;<br/><br/>
  But in His kindness He's brought us all together,<br/><br/>
  Oh come and join Him in this banquet made with love.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  If you want to be reconciled with Jesus,<br/><br/>
  You must abandon the illusions of this world;<br/><br/>
  Come now worship the feet of Jesus Christ,<br/><br/>
  Enjoy His blessings and forgiveness from your sin.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  All of the saints who rejoice in His communion,<br/><br/>
  Relinquish all that kept them far from Jesus Christ;<br/><br/>
  This feast is made in remembrance of His death,<br/><br/>
And as a memory of His passion and His love.</p></center>
