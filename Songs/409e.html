<center><p>409 OH I LOVE TO WALK WITH JESUS<br/><br/>
  Oh I love to walk with Jesus, like the publicans of old,<br/><br/>
  When He gathered them about Him, and the blessed tidings told;<br/><br/>
  How He came to bring deliverance, to the captives in distress,<br/><br/>
  Take away our ev'ry burden, giving perfect peace and rest.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Oh I will follow He leadeth,<br/><br/>
  Oh I will pasture where He feedeth;<br/><br/>
  Oh I will follow all the way, Lord,<br/><br/>
  I will follow Jesus ev'ry day.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Oh I love to walk with Jesus, like the men of long ago,<br/><br/>
  Who had tarried by the wayside, near the gates of Jericho;<br/><br/>
  Jesus heard his cry for mercy, gave him back his sight that day,<br/><br/>
  And immediately he followed, Jesus all along the way.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Oh I love to walk with Jesus, all the way to Calv'ry's brow,<br/><br/>
  Gaze upon that scene of suffering, while my tears of sorrow flow;<br/><br/>
  There He'll tell me how He loves me, takes my ev'ry sin away,<br/><br/>
So I follow Him so gladly, lead me anywhere He may.</p></center>
