<center><p>567 WE WILL CONQUER<br/><br/>
  We will conquer, yes we will conquer,<br/><br/>
  And arrive at our beloved home;<br/><br/>
  And we will be welcomed by Jesus,<br/><br/>
  And we will praise Him all day and night.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  My King has soldiers in the millions up high,<br/><br/>
  We are determined to battle for Christ;<br/><br/>
  And at their side, they have a corner stone,<br/><br/>
  This is the Captain, Jesus Christ the Lord.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  We'll be fighting, yes we'll be fighting,<br/><br/>
  With the help of Jesus Christ our Lord;<br/><br/>
  Triumphantly praising Jesus,<br/><br/>
  The Lamb who died nailed to the cross.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  If at nighttime the stars shine brightly,<br/><br/>
  God's church will shine brighter than them all;<br/><br/>
  Because it has a luminary,<br/><br/>
  That is brighter than all light of day.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  There are peoples trusting in fortune,<br/><br/>
  And the gods and goddesses they serve;<br/><br/>
  But the children of Jesus Christ,<br/><br/>
Shine on brighter than the stars above.</p></center>
