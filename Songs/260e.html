<center><p>260 NEVER ALONE<br/><br/>
  I've seen the lightening flashing, and heard the thunders roll,<br/><br/>
  I've felt sins breakers dashing trying to conquer my soul;<br/><br/>
  I've heard the voice of my Savior, telling me still to fight on,<br/><br/>
  He promised never to leave me, never to leave me alone.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  //No, never alone// He promised never to leave me;<br/><br/>
  Never to leave me alone.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  The world's fierce winds are blowing, temptations sharp and keen,<br/><br/>
  I feel a peace in knowing, my Savior stands between;<br/><br/>
  He stand to shield me from danger, when earthly friends are gone,<br/><br/>
  He promised never to leave me, never to leave me alone.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  He died for me on the mountain, for me they pierced His side,<br/><br/>
  For me He opened the fountain, the crimson cleansing tide;<br/><br/>
  For me He's waiting in glory, seated upon His throne,<br/><br/>
He promised never to leave me, never to leave me alone.</p></center>
