<center><p>414 JESUS IS PRAYING<br/><br/>
  Jesus is praying to the Father,<br/><br/>
  Suffering in Gethsemane;<br/><br/>
  And also on His radiant face,<br/><br/>
  Sweating with blood His forehead be.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Gethsemane, profound remembrance,<br/><br/>
  Gethsemane, a place of beauty;<br/><br/>
  Where I can see so humbly kneeling,<br/><br/>
  The eternal Son of our God.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  The soul of my good Jesus Christ,<br/><br/>
  Sad as when death has taken life;<br/><br/>
  Drinking the bitter chalice for us,<br/><br/>
  Only to redeem those who've sinned.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  In the pretorium he has peace,<br/><br/>
  Although they whip Him furiously;<br/><br/>
  The crown of thorns that they have made Him,<br/><br/>
  Now girds the forehead of my Christ.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  They have now nailed Him to the cross,<br/><br/>
  Oh sinner see how He bleeds;<br/><br/>
  He suffered because of your evils,<br/><br/>
Cruel shame and pain He bears for you.</p></center>
