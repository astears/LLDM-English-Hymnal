<center><p>134 FROM THE EAST AND FROM THE WEST<br/><br/>
  From the east and from the west they will come,<br/><br/>
  People who did not know Jehovah God;<br/><br/>
  They will come and they'll worship the Lord,<br/><br/>
  They will be singing praises to Him.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Nations never heard of will come,<br/><br/>
  People that we've never encountered;<br/><br/>
  Faces we've never contemplated,<br/><br/>
  We'll see them praising Jehovah our God.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  From all four continents they will arrive,<br/><br/>
  All those who will be chosen by the Lord;<br/><br/>
  These are the souls who once were found lost,<br/><br/>
  Now they bless their Redeemer today.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  The Lord spoke through His prophets about,<br/><br/>
  The promise Abraham received from God;<br/><br/>
  I will make a great nation of you,<br/><br/>
  This is the blessing of our Lord.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  All of us who have been blessed to know God,<br/><br/>
  Should always pay tribute to His name;<br/><br/>
  Because in His great kindness and love,<br/><br/>
He made us to be children of His.</p></center>
