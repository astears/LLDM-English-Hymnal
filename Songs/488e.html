<center><p>488 OH LORD, YOU SEE WITHIN MY HEART<br/><br/>
  Oh Lord, you see within my heart, the ways in which I think,<br/><br/>
  And when I meditate you weigh, my thoughts on balance beam.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Explore oh Lord my heart today; sift through all of my thoughts,<br/><br/>
  And see if there are any ungodly things;<br/><br/>
  And guide me in the life that is eternal.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  My thoughts and tongue you do know well, you know of all my Lord,<br/><br/>
  And wherever my soul will go, your favor I receive.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  If I am on the wings of dawn, the world that's far beyond,<br/><br/>
  I know that you are there with me, your hand is by my side.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  I can't hide myself from you God; you're always on my pursuit,<br/><br/>
  To you light and darkness alike, they differ not at all.<br/><br/>
  5<br/><br/>
  Oh Lord always be my fair Judge, with you I want to go,<br/><br/>
I long to be always with you, to never depart you.</p></center>
