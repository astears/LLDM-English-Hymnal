<center><p>219 ONWARD CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS<br/><br/>
  Onward Christian soldiers marching as to war,<br/><br/>
  With the cross of Jesus going on before;<br/><br/>
  Christ the royal Master, leads against the foe,<br/><br/>
  Forward into battle, see His banners go.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Onward Christian soldiers, marching as to war,<br/><br/>
  With the cross of Jesus going on before.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Like a mighty army, moves the church of God,<br/><br/>
  Brothers we are treading where the saints have trod;<br/><br/>
  We are not divided, all one body we,<br/><br/>
  One in hope and doctrine, one in charity.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Crowns and thrones may perish, kingdoms rise and wane,<br/><br/>
  But the church of Jesus constant will remain;<br/><br/>
  Gates of hell can never, 'gainst the church prevail,<br/><br/>
  We have Christ's own promise, which can never fail.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Onward then ye people, join our happy throng,<br/><br/>
  Blend with ours your voices, in the triumph song;<br/><br/>
  Glory, laud, and honor, unto Christ the King,<br/><br/>
This through countless ages, men and angels sing.</p></center>
