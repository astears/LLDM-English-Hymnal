<center><p>457 THERE IS POWER IN THE BLOOD<br/><br/>
  Would you be free from your burden of sin?<br/><br/>
  There's power in the blood, power in blood;<br/><br/>
  Would you o'er evil a victory win?<br/><br/>
  There's wonderful power in the blood.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  There is power, power, wonder working power,<br/><br/>
  In the blood of the Lamb;<br/><br/>
  There is power, power, wonder working power,<br/><br/>
  In the precious blood of the Lamb.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Would you be free from your passion and pride?<br/><br/>
  There's power in the blood, power in the blood;<br/><br/>
  Come for a cleansing to Calvary's tide,<br/><br/>
  There's wonderful power in the blood.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Would you be whiter, much whiter than snow?<br/><br/>
  There's power in the blood, power in the blood;<br/><br/>
  Sin stains are lost in its life giving flow,<br/><br/>
  There's wonderful power in the blood.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Would you do service for Jesus your King?<br/><br/>
  There's power in the blood, power in the blood;<br/><br/>
  Would you live daily His praises to sing?<br/><br/>
There's wonderful power in the blood.</p></center>
