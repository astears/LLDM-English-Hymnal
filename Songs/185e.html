<center><p>185 IN THE CHURCH OF CHRIST<br/><br/>
  In the church of Christ Jesus there's glasses of gold,<br/><br/>
  And of silver, metals of honor serving God;<br/><br/>
  If you want to serve faithful Christ Jesus your Lord,<br/><br/>
  ///You will know///<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  //You will know// from your life that your living on earth,<br/><br/>
  //You will know// from the life that you would like to live;<br/><br/>
  //You will know// in your conscience you will take account,<br/><br/>
  //You will know// when you go before the divine judge.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Christ will come in the clouds with all His splendor too,<br/><br/>
  Oh how sad, it will be, when He finds your heart bad;<br/><br/>
  To His voice listen now, and your sin leave behind,<br/><br/>
If you want, to go rest, with Lord Christ.</p></center>
