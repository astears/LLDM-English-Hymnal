<center><p>443 YOU NEVER MENTIONED HIM TO ME<br/><br/>
  When in the better land, before the bar we stand,<br/><br/>
  How deeply grieved our souls may be;<br/><br/>
  If any lost one there should cry in deep despair,<br/><br/>
  &quot;You never mentioned Him to me.&quot;<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  &quot;You never mentioned Him to me,<br/><br/>
  You helped me not the light to see;<br/><br/>
  You met me day by day, and knew I was astray,<br/><br/>
  Yet you never mentioned Him to me.&quot;<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Oh let us spread the word where e'er it may be heard,<br/><br/>
  Help groping souls the light to see;<br/><br/>
  That yonder none may say,<br/><br/>
  &quot;You showed me not the way,&quot;<br/><br/>
  &quot;You never mentioned Him to me.&quot;<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  A few sweet words may guide a lost one to His side,<br/><br/>
  Or turn sad eyes on Calvary;<br/><br/>
  So work as days go by, that yonder none may cry,<br/><br/>
&quot;You never mentioned Him to me.&quot;</p></center>
