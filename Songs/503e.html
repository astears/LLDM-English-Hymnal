<center><p>503 I FOLLOW MY SAVIOR<br/><br/>
  My Redeemer and Lord,<br/><br/>
  I follow through the path,<br/><br/>
  I'm a sheep of his great flock;<br/><br/>
  I am guided with love; by my good shepherd,<br/><br/>
  I'm the sheep under His care.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  How great is my Lord, the most wonderful in deeds,<br/><br/>
  He forgives all our sins, not repaying evilly.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  I follow Jesus Christ; He is guidance to me,<br/><br/>
  He's my Sheppard and my Father;<br/><br/>
  As I journey through life, he keeps me on the path,<br/><br/>
  From all evil things he guards me.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Jesus Christ my dear Lord,<br/><br/>
  He who's caring for me,<br/><br/>
  He is watching from distance;<br/><br/>
  His protecting my path, always guiding me through,<br/><br/>
Not a moment He forgets me.</p></center>
