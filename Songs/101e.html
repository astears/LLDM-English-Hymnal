<center><p>101 CHRIST IS A STAR<br/><br/>
  Christ is a star shining brightly, He is our Pastor Lord,<br/><br/>
  He will take care of our beings, through the doorway of love;<br/><br/>
  For this we give Him all glory, to our Redeemer divine,<br/><br/>
  For this we're singing so joyful, We saints to whom He has freed.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  All souls that have been wandering, through this dark world of hate,<br/><br/>
  They can come now to Lord Jesus, He will forgive their crimes;<br/><br/>
  Look He's so eagerly calling, to His great banquet of love,<br/><br/>
  So that you no longer wander from the truth found in our God.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Come to the fountain of life, who can save your dear soul,<br/><br/>
  Christ will take you to His glory, if you want to be there;<br/><br/>
  It's necessary you look at, in all the pathways you walk,<br/><br/>
Only one pathway will take you, up towards His eternity.</p></center>
