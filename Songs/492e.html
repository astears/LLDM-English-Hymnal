<center><p>492 IF SOMEONE HAS THE UNDERSTANDING<br/><br/>
  If someone has the understanding, they will find the basic knowledge,<br/><br/>
  Of the Father, of Jesus, and the Spirit sent from God;<br/><br/>
  Combine all three into one, and you'll see it was revealed,<br/><br/>
  All these three are actually one.<br/><br/>
  While on quicksand some build over, though unstable and unsteady,<br/><br/>
  Others on the rock made firm and eternal;<br/><br/>
  Some believe in the false doctrines, others in the word of truth,<br/><br/>
  In Christ Jesus truth is found.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  It is Jesus the truth, the true pathway and the light,<br/><br/>
  God in Him, the plenitude of the great divinity.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Some accept the Lord's baptism which is found in the Lord's gospel,<br/><br/>
  Baptism, of immersion, to pardon all vile sins;<br/><br/>
  Others making rules of man, by tradition without God,<br/><br/>
  Baptize in their own ways.<br/><br/>
  Christ in Matthew 28, gives the order of baptism,<br/><br/>
  This baptism which all persons all will obey;<br/><br/>
  For this Acts 2:38, Peter speaks of Christ's baptism,<br/><br/>
  And He lets us know the truth.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  All three Apostles in the Bible, confirm, witnessing the truth,<br/><br/>
  Baptism, in the name of our Savior Jesus Christ;<br/><br/>
  Three Apostles of the Lord, Peter, John and also Paul,<br/><br/>
  They confirm to us this light.<br/><br/>
  There are witnesses above, from the heavens shedding light,<br/><br/>
  Our Father, His words and, the Spirit of the Lord;<br/><br/>
  And this glorious mystery, John declares it to the world,<br/><br/>
  All these three are actually one.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  God's son Jesus Christ is with us, sent from God down to be with us,<br/><br/>
  Our Father, in heaven, the Prince of all the peace;<br/><br/>
  In beginning there was Word, and the word was with our God,<br/><br/>
  And the Word was our dear Lord.<br/><br/>
  If someone has the understanding, they will find the basic knowledge,<br/><br/>
  Of the Father, of Jesus, and of the Spirit sent from God;<br/><br/>
  Combine all three into one, and you'll see it was revealed,<br/><br/>
All these three are actually one.</p></center>
