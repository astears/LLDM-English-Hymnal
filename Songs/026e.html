<center><p>026 SITTING AT THE FEET OF JESUS<br/><br/>
  Sitting at the feet of Jesus, Oh what Words I hear Him say!<br/><br/>
  Happy place! So near so precious! May it find me there each day;<br/><br/>
  Sitting at the feet of Jesus, I would look upon the past,<br/><br/>
  For His love has been so gracious, it has won my heart at last.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Sitting at the feet of Jesus, where can mortal be more blest?<br/><br/>
  There I lay my sins and sorrows, and when weary find sweet rest;<br/><br/>
  Sitting at the feet of Jesus, there I love to weep and pray,<br/><br/>
  While I from His fullness gather, grace and comfort every day.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Bless me, Oh my Savior, bless me, as I sit low at Thy feet,<br/><br/>
  Oh, look down in love upon me, let me see Thy face so sweet;<br/><br/>
  Give me Lord the mind of Jesus, make me holy as He is,<br/><br/>
May I prove I've been with Jesus, who is all my righteousness.</p></center>
