<center><p>558 A HOPE WAS BORN<br/><br/>
  A hope was born and reigning in my soul,<br/><br/>
  Since times of darkness when I was a slave;<br/><br/>
  Without directions walking place to place,<br/><br/>
  But Jesus saved my soul and gave me light.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Salvation's in Jesus Christ,<br/><br/>
  Don't doubt His power, trust in Him;<br/><br/>
  Come then to Him without delay,<br/><br/>
  Come to give Him all of your heart.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  I am a witness to the power of God,<br/><br/>
  'Cause many wonders He has done in me;<br/><br/>
  I once was blind, but now I see the light,<br/><br/>
  Celestial light, that which is Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Christ in His death atoned for all our sins,<br/><br/>
  A special sacrifice for you and me;<br/><br/>
  Rest you will have in the sheepfold of God,<br/><br/>
  Repenting fully from all of your faults.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Don't wander more, you who is lost in sin,<br/><br/>
  Come to Christ Jesus, He'll forgive your soul;<br/><br/>
  Leave this whole world and all its vanity,<br/><br/>
Salvation only comes from Jesus Christ.</p></center>
