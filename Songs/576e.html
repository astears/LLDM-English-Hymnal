<center><p>576 SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST CAME<br/><br/>
  Savior Jesus Christ came, only to suffer here,<br/><br/>
  So His blood would runneth over, for you and for me.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Perhaps tomorrow //There'll be no place//<br/><br/>
  Jesus Christ tells you //come don't delay//<br/><br/>
  The day is passing, the night is coming,<br/><br/>
  Perhaps tomorrow will be too late.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Jesus Christ is calling you; listen to His tender voice,<br/><br/>
  With effort He calls to you, saying &quot;sinner come.&quot;<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Don't wait for the new dawning, or say Jesus Christ won't come,<br/><br/>
  Perhaps in the morning, it will be too late.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  When inside your casket lying, it will be too late to pray,<br/><br/>
To implore to Christ Jesus, who now wants your soul.</p></center>
