<center><p>201 YOU ARE LIKE THE CEDARS OF LEBANON<br/><br/>
  You are like the cedars of Lebanon, just like streams of running water,<br/><br/>
  In greatness and full of power is the Apostle of God;<br/><br/>
  Like the stars up in the heavens, like the sand that lie in the sea,<br/><br/>
  Just like that are His blessed people, people now chosen by our God,<br/><br/>
  And all powerful in truth.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Israel is an all powerful battalion,<br/><br/>
  Everyone's ready just like soldiers in a war;<br/><br/>
  The banners wave all together in high places,<br/><br/>
  In the midst of the holy people, is the one that our God has chosen;<br/><br/>
  A great Apostle of the Lord.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Who is there like you among the people, you've made laws that are so holy,<br/><br/>
  On firm rock they have foundation in Jesus Christ our Lord;<br/><br/>
  No one has our God so nearby, like His people children of God,<br/><br/>
  All saved now by our Jesus, rejoicing in wondrous teachings;<br/><br/>
  Holy people of the Lord.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  He's the most important of His people,<br/><br/>
  He was chosen by my Jesus,<br/><br/>
  Apostle all full of God's grace you are the one sent from God;<br/><br/>
  Your enemies you shall not fear, although like a lion they roar,<br/><br/>
  The God of gods is your refuge, all of your people are with you;<br/><br/>
Holy Apostle of the Lord.</p></center>
