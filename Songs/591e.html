<center><p>591 IF JESUS GOES WITH ME<br/><br/>
  It may be in the valley where countless dangers hide,<br/><br/>
  It may be in the sunshine that I in peace abide;<br/><br/>
  But this one thing I know, if it be dark or fair,<br/><br/>
  If Jesus is with me, I'll go anywhere.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  If Jesus goes with me, I'll go anywhere,<br/><br/>
  Tis' heaven to me, where e'er I may be, if He is there!<br/><br/>
  I counted a privilege here, His cross to bear,<br/><br/>
  If Jesus goes with me, I'll go anywhere.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  It may be I must carry the blessed word of life,<br/><br/>
  Across the burning deserts to those in sinful strife;<br/><br/>
  And tho' it be my lot to bear my colors there,<br/><br/>
  If Jesus goes with me, I'll go anywhere.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  But if it be my portion, to bear my cross at home,<br/><br/>
  While others bear their burdens, beyond the billow's foam;<br/><br/>
  I'll prove my faith in Him, confess my judgments fair,<br/><br/>
  And if He stays with me, I'll go anywhere.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  It is not mine to question the judgments of my Lord,<br/><br/>
  It is but mine to follow, the leadings of His word;<br/><br/>
  But if to go or stay, or whether here or there,<br/><br/>
I'll be with my Savior, content anywhere.</p></center>
