<center><p>151 SWEET HOUR OF PRAYER<br/><br/>
  //Sweet hour of prayer// That calls me from a world of care;<br/><br/>
  And bids me at my Father's throne,<br/><br/>
  Makes all my wants and wishes known.<br/><br/>
  In seasons of distress and grief,<br/><br/>
  My soul has always found relief;<br/><br/>
  And oft escaped the tempter's snare,<br/><br/>
  By thy return, sweet hour of prayer.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  // Sweet hour of prayer// Thy wings shall my petition bear;<br/><br/>
  To Him whose truth and faithfulness,<br/><br/>
  Engage the waiting soul to bless.<br/><br/>
  And since He bids me seek His face,<br/><br/>
  Believe His word and trust His grace;<br/><br/>
  I'll cast on Him my every care,<br/><br/>
  And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  // Sweet hour of prayer// May I thy consolation share;<br/><br/>
  Till from Mount Zion's lofty height,<br/><br/>
  I view my home and take my flight.<br/><br/>
  This robe of flesh I'll drop and rise,<br/><br/>
  To seize the everlasting prize;<br/><br/>
  And shout while passing through the air,<br/><br/>
Farewell, farewell, sweet hour of prayer.</p></center>
