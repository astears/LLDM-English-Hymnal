<center><p>516 ONLY JESUS CHRIST IN GOD<br/><br/>
  Only Jesus Christ in God, and no other does exist,<br/><br/>
  Nor in heaven, nor on the earth, nor the bottom of the sea;<br/><br/>
  Author of this universe, that which a man came to save,<br/><br/>
  And it is Him who's preparing, to come down and judge the world.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  And the church of Jesus Christ which was established through His name,<br/><br/>
  To the one who wants salvation, the door is let wide open;<br/><br/>
  You may chose, there's many doors but the others will not prevail,<br/><br/>
  And if Jesus finds them open, He will close them in His wrath.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Many now deny Lord Jesus, and announce the trinity,<br/><br/>
  With their arrogance they speak lies, that in sum are vanity;<br/><br/>
  These are all the fraudulent preachers, that deceive humanity,<br/><br/>
  That do not adore Christ Jesus, in their Spirits and in truth.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  His evangel is preached, to all human conscience here,<br/><br/>
  Those who will believe in Jesus, may another day not pass;<br/><br/>
  In this day there is salvation, that's established by the Lord,<br/><br/>
If the Lord is calling to you, do not make your heart a stone.</p></center>
