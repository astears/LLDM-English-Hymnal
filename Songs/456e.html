<center><p>456 WHO WILL BE MY BONDSMAN?<br/><br/>
  Who will be my bondsman? I asked after I left,<br/><br/>
  Forever the pathways corrupted by sin;<br/><br/>
  When the almighty judge before me I did see,<br/><br/>
  Who will I have in the end: as a justice for me?<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  When the almighty judge comes to my soul to weigh,<br/><br/>
  And a bondsman He asks me for my immortal soul;<br/><br/>
  The Lord Jesus Christ will come and defend me,<br/><br/>
  And exclaim with great love: I will respond for thee.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Oh how dark was my past, that I saw on the cross,<br/><br/>
  Oh how many vile sins in the pathway I walked;<br/><br/>
  For there were no good things to be found in my life,<br/><br/>
  Who will then for my soul, want to respond for me?<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  It was justice whom I saw when brought to the scale,<br/><br/>
  And I trembled and moaned as I stepped on the scale;<br/><br/>
  As I weighed myself there, and I saw all my faults,<br/><br/>
Who will then for my soul, want to respond for me?</p></center>
