<center><p>569 I COME TO BRING YOU<br/><br/>
  I come to bring you, oh Ambassador,<br/><br/>
  A song from heaven, new from the royal home;<br/><br/>
  I come to tell you, don't you be scared,<br/><br/>
  To make well known to the peoples God's message of peace.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  I come to offer, Servant of the Lord,<br/><br/>
  A golden powder from a great treasure;<br/><br/>
  It's from the deepest part of all my heart.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  A gold crown of diamonds,<br/><br/>
  God has placed on you,<br/><br/>
  And in a gold seat, will be where you sit;<br/><br/>
  When the Lord's mission you have fulfilled,<br/><br/>
  You are my faithful Servant, God will say to you.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Now all your children, those esteeming you,<br/><br/>
  We hope to see you, forever with a smile;<br/><br/>
  It is a blessing, to see your face,<br/><br/>
It is our wish from your hands to receive God's news.</p></center>
