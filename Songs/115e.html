<center><p>115 WHEN WE HAVE CEASED TO EXIST<br/><br/>
  When we have ceased to exist,<br/><br/>
  We'll go to a much better place;<br/><br/>
  We'll be blissful when we feel,<br/><br/>
  We won't return, never again;<br/><br/>
  Although I may suffer here,<br/><br/>
  I will be joyful with Him there;<br/><br/>
  I'll go to glory and not return,<br/><br/>
  Never will I return.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  A faithful Servant of God, in heaven, Yes!<br/><br/>
  I will find, With those who will await for us, hoping to never return;<br/><br/>
  All things will be felicity, free from all anguish and all pain,<br/><br/>
  I'll go to glory and not return, never, will I return.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Joyful I am to meditate, That one day I'll be with Jesus;<br/><br/>
  That from this day my song will be, I won't return, never again;<br/><br/>
  That place could never be compared, Seeing the Apostle of the Lord;<br/><br/>
  He went to glory and will return, Yes, soon, he will return.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Not too far off the day will be, When we will sing with Jesus Christ;<br/><br/>
  A new celestial song we'll sing, We won't return, never again;<br/><br/>
  When I will walk through golden streets, With the anointed of the Lord; He lives in<br/><br/>
glory, and will return, Yes, soon, he will return.</p></center>
