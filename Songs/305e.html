<center><p>305 THE WORK IS OF JESUS<br/><br/>
  The work is of Jesus, from Him is all the pow'r,<br/><br/>
  We as His people, following our Lord.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Let all the souls come to Jesus, don't avoid Him, friend,<br/><br/>
  'Cause Christ is the door and we'll enter through Him.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Christ Jesus is always, the same now forever,<br/><br/>
  Those who believe in Christ never will die.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  The life comes from Jesus,<br/><br/>
  He brings no confusion,<br/><br/>
  Confused ones will not enter His home above.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  The Bible now tells us, from Jesus Christ our Lord,<br/><br/>
  He's the only pathway, that's flowing with light.<br/><br/>
  5<br/><br/>
  There's no other name that is able to save,<br/><br/>
  And it's Jesus Christ, so do not be misled.<br/><br/>
  6<br/><br/>
  Close to the Lord Jesus, we should always be,<br/><br/>
A feeling so joyful, and with Him we will reign.</p></center>
