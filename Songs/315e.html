<center><p>315 I'VE GIVEN JESUS MY WHOLE LIFE<br/><br/>
  I've given Jesus my whole life,<br/><br/>
  A hope that changed the way I lived past times ago;<br/><br/>
  He saved my soul through His grace that is so blessed,<br/><br/>
  He chose me so that I fulfill all that He wants.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Nothing is nobler, nothing more worthy,<br/><br/>
  Than consecrating our whole lives to Jesus Christ;<br/><br/>
  Needles and thorns that are in His pathway,<br/><br/>
  His blessed presence is the one that sanctifies it.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  I understand what the price is,<br/><br/>
  To follow Jesus in the steps of His labor;<br/><br/>
  It does not matter I will keep my forehead upright,<br/><br/>
  And by your grace I'll be more than a conqueror.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  I could not pay you with my life,<br/><br/>
  What your sweet love in Calvary did for my soul;<br/><br/>
  My life and faith at your full service are surrendered,<br/><br/>
  Just as a consecrated offering to you.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  I consecrate to you my life,<br/><br/>
  It's for your service oh my precious Savior Lord;<br/><br/>
  A crown of glory I will wear up in the heavens,<br/><br/>
For every soul that I can rescue through your love.</p></center>
