<center><p>427 IT IS A TRUE PLEASURE<br/><br/>
  It is a true pleasure to serve Jesus Christ,<br/><br/>
  No payment is greater, or work more nobler;<br/><br/>
  I would like to serve Him, with faith and with love,<br/><br/>
  I promise to serve Him hence forth.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  To serve Jesus Christ, to serve Him with faith,<br/><br/>
  What rich and sweet payment I'll have;<br/><br/>
  Suffering will not matter, He suffered for me,<br/><br/>
  I am happy, serving Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  I will speak the truth and always be faithful,<br/><br/>
  No matter if I lose everything for Him;<br/><br/>
  Such eternal riches in Christ I will have,<br/><br/>
  Hence forth I will only serve Him.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  The hatred of this world for Him I will bear,<br/><br/>
  The burden I know without doubt will be hard;<br/><br/>
  I know that I will not ever lack His grace,<br/><br/>
I will serve my Christ till the end.</p></center>
