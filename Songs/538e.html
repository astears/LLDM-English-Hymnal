<center><p>538 I HAVE A HOPE<br/><br/>
  I have a hope that's growing so firm and so greatly,<br/><br/>
  That even in heaven, it can be seen;<br/><br/>
  For this I'm confiding, in your love so sacred,<br/><br/>
  Just as a faithful soldier, I would like to win.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Jesus from heaven so blessed,<br/><br/>
  He is the one who guards me;<br/><br/>
  So I can go to the heavens,<br/><br/>
  Where I would like to reign Lord.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  When it's time to rise up, my life here is over,<br/><br/>
  My God tells me to go, so I must depart;<br/><br/>
  But while I'm on this earth, I walk as a pilgrim,<br/><br/>
  And my destiny's to, suffer while I'm here.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Rising up to heaven, from this world to you Lord,<br/><br/>
  With pain felt profoundly,<br/><br/>
  I'm going to leave here;<br/><br/>
  Remembering the phrases, that I was once was praying,<br/><br/>
  That up in the heavens we'll be face to face.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  The peoples are saying, that we're holy rollers,<br/><br/>
  But a holy roller, is glory of God;<br/><br/>
  If only these people knew what they were saying,<br/><br/>
They would never blaspheme the Word of God.</p></center>
