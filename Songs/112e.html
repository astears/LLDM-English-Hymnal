<center><p>112 WHEN MY LIFE WORK HAS ENDED<br/><br/>
  When my life work has ended and I cross the swelling tide,<br/><br/>
  When the bright and glorious morning I will see;<br/><br/>
  I will call my Redeemer when I reach the other side,<br/><br/>
  And His smile will be the first to welcome me.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  I will know Him, I will know Him,<br/><br/>
  All the redeemed by his side I shall surely stand;<br/><br/>
  I will know Him, I will know Him,<br/><br/>
  By the print of the nails in His hands.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Oh, the soul thrilling rapture when I view His blessed face,<br/><br/>
  And the luster of His kindly beaming eye;<br/><br/>
  How my heart full of joy will praise His love, grace, and mercy,<br/><br/>
  That prepare for me a mansion in the sky.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Oh, the dear ones in glory, how they'll beckon me to come,<br/><br/>
  And our parting at the river I recall;<br/><br/>
  In the valleys of Eden they'll be singing: welcome home,<br/><br/>
  But I long to meet my Savior first of all.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Through the gates to the city in a robe of spotless white,<br/><br/>
  He will lead me where no tears will ever fall;<br/><br/>
  In the glad song of ages I will mingle with delight,<br/><br/>
But I long to meet my Savior first of all.</p></center>
