<center><p>511 ZION, CELESTIAL CITY<br/><br/>
  Zion celestial city, there I'm waiting to live,<br/><br/>
  Zion you are my desire;<br/><br/>
  Where ever I will see you my God and our Lord.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  I am weary in the desert, discouraged I may become,<br/><br/>
  But then the Lamb of my God comes to my rescue to save;<br/><br/>
  Quickly He comes to my side, and He calms me from within,<br/><br/>
  And to that heavenly city I continue to walk on.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Zion city of truth I want to see you myself,<br/><br/>
  Zion city of my Jesus who was crucified;<br/><br/>
  Just so He could save my soul.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Zion further than the sun, I will look upon you,<br/><br/>
  Zion promised from the Father;<br/><br/>
That Jesus Christ our Savior He went up to prepare.</p></center>
