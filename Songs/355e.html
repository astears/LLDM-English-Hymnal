<center><p>355 THE CHILD OF A KING<br/><br/>
  My Father is rich, in houses and lands,<br/><br/>
  He holdeth the wealth of the world in His hands;<br/><br/>
  Of rubies and diamonds, of silver and gold,<br/><br/>
  His coffers are full, He has riches untold.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  //I'm a child of a King, The child of a King;<br/><br/>
  With Jesus my Savior, I'm a child of a King//<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  My Father's own son, the Savior of men,<br/><br/>
  Once wandered on earth, as the poorest of them;<br/><br/>
  But now He is reigning forever on high,<br/><br/>
  And will give me a home, in heaven by and by.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  I once was an outcast, stranger on earth,<br/><br/>
  A sinner by choice and an alien by birth;<br/><br/>
  But I've been adopted, my names written down,<br/><br/>
  An heir to a mansion, a robe, and a crown.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  A tent or a cottage, why should I care?<br/><br/>
  They're building a palace for me over there;<br/><br/>
  Tho' exiled from home, yet still I may sing,<br/><br/>
All glory to God; I'm a child of a King.</p></center>
