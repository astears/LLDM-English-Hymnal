<center><p>080 AS THE PERFUME<br/><br/>
  As the perfume that gives off a pleasant aroma,<br/><br/>
  As the perfume dismisses such a precious scent;<br/><br/>
  Like the incense offered to Jesus our Savior,<br/><br/>
  Such is the prayer that is filled with great love and faith.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Faith is the proof, demonstration of,<br/><br/>
  All the things that we cannot see;<br/><br/>
  But we all know that when He's finally appearing,<br/><br/>
  We all will be as Christ is, Spirit just as He.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  The pleasant incense for the offering is at hand,<br/><br/>
  It's in the hand of the angel that serves the Lord;<br/><br/>
  Because his people here have always been exhaling,<br/><br/>
  The hopeful prayers that smell as perfume to my Lord.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Elijah prayed so that a fire came from heaven,<br/><br/>
  It was through faith that Joshua halted the sun;<br/><br/>
  And Jesus Christ through faith performed the greatest marvels,<br/><br/>
It was through justice that to heaven He arose.</p></center>
