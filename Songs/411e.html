<center><p>411 MAY THE LORD ANSWER YOU<br/><br/>
  May the Lord answer you when you are in distress,<br/><br/>
  May the name of the God of Jacob protect you;<br/><br/>
  May he send you help from the sanctuary,<br/><br/>
  //And grant you support from Zion//<br/><br/>
  May he remember all your sacrifices,<br/><br/>
  And accept your burnt offerings;<br/><br/>
  //May He give you the desire of your heart,<br/><br/>
  And make all your plans succeed//<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  We will shout for joy when you are victorious,<br/><br/>
  //And will lift up our banners in the name of our God//<br/><br/>
  May the Lord grant all your requests.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Now I know that the Lord saves His anointed,<br/><br/>
  He answers him from His holy heaven;<br/><br/>
  With the saving power of His right hand,<br/><br/>
  Some trust in chariots and some in horses;<br/><br/>
  But we trust in the name of the Lord our God.<br/><br/>
  2nd. CHORUS<br/><br/>
  They are brought to their knees and fall,<br/><br/>
  But we rise up and stand firm;<br/><br/>
//Oh Lord//, save the king, Answer us when we call, Amen.</p></center>
