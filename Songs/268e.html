<center><p>268 NAILED TO THE CROSS<br/><br/>
  There was one who was willing to die in my stead,<br/><br/>
  That a soul so unworthy might live;<br/><br/>
  And the path to the cross;<br/><br/>
  He was willing to die,<br/><br/>
  All the sins of my life to forgive.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  // They are nailed to the cross//<br/><br/>
  Oh how much He was willing to bear;<br/><br/>
  With what anguish and loss,<br/><br/>
  Jesus went to the cross,<br/><br/>
  But He carried my sins with Him there.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  He is tender and loving and patient with me,<br/><br/>
  While He cleanses my soul of the dross;<br/><br/>
  But there's no condemnation,<br/><br/>
  I know I am free,<br/><br/>
  For my sins are all nailed to the cross.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  I will cling to my Savior and never depart,<br/><br/>
  I will joyfully journey each day;<br/><br/>
  With a song on my lips and a song in my heart,<br/><br/>
That my sins have been taken away.</p></center>
