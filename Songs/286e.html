<center><p>286 JESUS IS MY REFUGE<br/><br/>
  Jesus is my refuge, in every tempest shore,<br/><br/>
  He is the firm rock of the eternity;<br/><br/>
  The wind shall never move me, nor will it trouble me,<br/><br/>
  //For Jesus is my refuge// I shall not be in need.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  The turbulent waves, they rush against me,<br/><br/>
  And the obscure nights, they start to cover me;<br/><br/>
  My boat is navigating, the port it's reaching now,<br/><br/>
  //For Jesus is my refuge// I shall not be in need.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Jesus is the friend, of all humanity,<br/><br/>
  He is the medicine of every sickness too;<br/><br/>
  I shall not fear the battle, for He will guide me through,<br/><br/>
  //For Jesus is the friend// of all humanity.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Jesus is now calling, He is the captain now,<br/><br/>
  If you're a faithful soldier, prepare yourself today;<br/><br/>
  He calls you to the battle, oh come to defend him,<br/><br/>
//For Jesus is now calling// His voice is saying come.</p></center>
