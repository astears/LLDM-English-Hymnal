<center><p>264 HOSANNAS WE GIVE<br/><br/>
  Hosannas we give the King of glory,<br/><br/>
  Because in Calvary He had a victory;<br/><br/>
  For His precious blood that He had shed,<br/><br/>
  All heaven and earth shall give Him praise.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Oh my dear Savior I do love you,<br/><br/>
  For you gave yourself up for my sins;<br/><br/>
  For death you suffered, upon the cross,<br/><br/>
  This was to buy us our salvation.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  I can't repay you this debt that's so great,<br/><br/>
  Because you loved and then forgave me;<br/><br/>
  To serve and love you is my ambition,<br/><br/>
  Let's rejoice always in your blessings.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  The pain you suffered brings tears to my eyes,<br/><br/>
  Cruel and deep anguish and great affliction;<br/><br/>
  The bloody trials you overcame,<br/><br/>
  Your name oh Jesus, immortal be.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  It's our desire oh King of heaven,<br/><br/>
  You keep us faithful in all your pathway;<br/><br/>
  So that in one day up in your home,<br/><br/>
Of all your blessings we shall rejoice.</p></center>
