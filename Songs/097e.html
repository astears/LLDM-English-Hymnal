For His wondrous love.<br/><br/>  CHORUS<br/><br/>  I believe the Bible,<br/><br/>  Oh it's so divine! Heaven's golden sunlight in its pages shine;<br/><br/>  Lights my way to glory,<br/><br/>  I'm surely going thro',<br/><br/>  I believe the Bible, for it is so true.<br/><br/>  2<br/><br/>  I believe the Bible, it teaches me to sing,<br/><br/>  Moses' song of vic'try o'er the tyrant king;<br/><br/>  I have songs of victory flowing from my heart,<br/><br/>  Glory Hallelujah! For His perfect peace.<br/><br/>  3<br/><br/>  I believe the Bible, of holiness it speaks,<br/><br/>  Gracious gift from Jesus to the one who seeks;<br/><br/>  Tales of keeping power, though the tides are rough,<br/><br/>  Glory hallelujah!
