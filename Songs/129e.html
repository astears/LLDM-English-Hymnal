<center><p>129 GIVE ME JUST ONE GLANCE<br/><br/>
  Give me just one glance, from atop your dwelling,<br/><br/>
  Give me my Lord, one blessing today;<br/><br/>
  I want to feel in my soul,<br/><br/>
  That you are dwelling now in my heart.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Oh Lord Jesus,<br/><br/>
  I want to live in your refuge,<br/><br/>
  I want to feel as I live on;<br/><br/>
  That I'm directed by your hand.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Give me consolation, which is what I long for,<br/><br/>
  Give me my Lord, one blessing today;<br/><br/>
  I want to feel in my soul,<br/><br/>
  That you are living now in my heart.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Give now your forgiveness to my heart I pray,<br/><br/>
  Give me my Lord, of your charity;<br/><br/>
  I want to feel in my soul,<br/><br/>
  That all my wickedness was erased.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Give me just one glance, from atop your dwelling,<br/><br/>
  Give consolation to me oh Lord;<br/><br/>
  I want to feel in my soul,<br/><br/>
That you are reigning now in my heart.</p></center>
