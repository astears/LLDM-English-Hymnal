<center><p>391 OH HOW PRECIOUS<br/><br/>
  Oh how precious it is to worship Jesus Christ,<br/><br/>
  And meditate in all the words of our Lord;<br/><br/>
  Always waiting with great patience for His coming,<br/><br/>
  Consolation for eternity will be.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  //It will be so precious to fly to heaven,<br/><br/>
  Arrive with Jesus and give Him praise//<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  How very precious is the meeting of the brothers,<br/><br/>
  Those who are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ;<br/><br/>
  Always waiting for the promise from their Father,<br/><br/>
  That through Jesus He will send to us with love.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  And on that day when justice will be shinning highly,<br/><br/>
  We will all be under the order of our Lord;<br/><br/>
  Leaping up just as a calf does in a wild herd,<br/><br/>
  Giving glories, hallelujahs to the Lord.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Look at those masses they are clean and have been whitened,<br/><br/>
  Who might they be? They come with palms placed in their hands;<br/><br/>
  These ones have passed through many great tribulations,<br/><br/>
And the blood of Jesus Christ has cleansed their souls.</p></center>
