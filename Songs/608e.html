<center><p>608 I REMEMBER WHEN MY BURDENS<br/><br/>
  I remember when my burdens rolled away,<br/><br/>
  I carried them for years, night and day;<br/><br/>
  When I sought the blessed Lord, and I took Him at His word,<br/><br/>
  Then at once all my burdens rolled away.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  //Rolled away// I am happy since my burdens rolled away;<br/><br/>
  //Rolled away// I am happy since my burdens rolled away.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  I remember when my burdens rolled away,<br/><br/>
  That I feared would never leave, night or day;<br/><br/>
  Jesus showed to me the loss, so I left them at the cross,<br/><br/>
  I was glad when my burdens rolled away.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  I remember when my burdens rolled away,<br/><br/>
  That had hindered me for years, night and day;<br/><br/>
  As I sought the throne of grace, just a glimpse of Jesus' face,<br/><br/>
  And I knew that my burdens could not stay,<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  I am singing since my burdens rolled away,<br/><br/>
  There's a song within my heart night and day;<br/><br/>
  I am living for my King, and with joy I shout and sing,<br/><br/>
&quot;Hallelujah, all my burdens rolled away!&quot;</p></center>
