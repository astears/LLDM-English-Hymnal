<center><p>585 I AM NOW SAVED<br/><br/>
  I am now saved, through you my Christ, with all your pow'r,<br/><br/>
  Oh what a joy I feel in me, when I recall;<br/><br/>
  That through your bloodshed from your flesh, upon the cross,<br/><br/>
  One day I'll be with you in that celestial place.<br/><br/>
  Enjoying your wonderful love in plentitude,<br/><br/>
  For this I come kneeled at your feet to shed my tears;<br/><br/>
  My tears of love and gratitude spilled from my heart,<br/><br/>
  Knowing that all my guilty sins you have erased.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  I cry with gratitude, with running tears of love,<br/><br/>
  What can I offer you? Only my heart and soul;<br/><br/>
  What can depart me Lord, from your beloved flock?<br/><br/>
  Do guard my soul from sin, my divine Savior Lord.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Oh Jesus Christ, my sweetest Friend, I adore you,<br/><br/>
  Kneeled at your feet, I come to bring a sacrifice;<br/><br/>
  An offering full of my love, and full of peace,<br/><br/>
  For what you suffered for my soul, oh my good Lord.<br/><br/>
  All of my happiness I show to you my King,<br/><br/>
  Because my faults you have forgiven with your love;<br/><br/>
  Take then my life and all my being, for they're yours,<br/><br/>
Accept this song in which I sing from all my heart.</p></center>
