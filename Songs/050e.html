<center><p>050 ALTHOUGH IN THIS LIFETIME<br/><br/>
  Although in this lifetime, I have not a fortune,<br/><br/>
  I know up in glory, a palace is mine;<br/><br/>
  I was like a lost soul, in distress and hardship,<br/><br/>
  But Christ Jesus my Lord, empathized with me.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  //Further than the sun// I have a grand home,<br/><br/>
  My home, lovely home, //Further than the sun//<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  And if in this world, I walk through the darkness,<br/><br/>
  Temptations surround me, many struggles too;<br/><br/>
  But I hear my Savior, calling unto me,<br/><br/>
  Only He will save me, and take me back home.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  To all of the nations, of the human lineage,<br/><br/>
  Jesus wants to give them, word of salvation;<br/><br/>
  And a palace also, not built up by hands,<br/><br/>
That He has prepared us, in His mansion high.</p></center>
