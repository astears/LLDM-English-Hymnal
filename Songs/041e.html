<center><p>041 OH BLESSED APOSTLE<br/><br/>
  Oh blessed Apostle, a leader by God,<br/><br/>
  A tireless warrior who doesn't fear the war;<br/><br/>
  In Jesus your Savior you have won the war,<br/><br/>
  Confiding you follow your King and your Lord.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Oh you blessed Servant, who announces God,<br/><br/>
  Messenger sent from God; of a vibrant voice;<br/><br/>
  You are the Announcer, of the light and truth,<br/><br/>
  You're the one who's chosen to give liberty.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  To triumph and victory the Lord Christ calls you,<br/><br/>
  As a valiant servant your light shineth bright;<br/><br/>
  With joy in the world you are sowing with love,<br/><br/>
  Continually fighting with valor till end.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Constantly sowing, continue to plant,<br/><br/>
  If the King of hell is shrewd and astute;<br/><br/>
  Don't fear, God's protection will guard you in love,<br/><br/>
  And you have Christ Jesus profound in your heart.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  No human dominion can conquer your being,<br/><br/>
  The weapons of mankind will easily break;<br/><br/>
  But Christ Jesus gives you His armor of steel,<br/><br/>
And you as your father will conquer and win.</p></center>
