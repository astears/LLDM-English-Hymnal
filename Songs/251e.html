<center><p>251 THERE IS A FOUNTAIN FILLED<br/><br/>
  There is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins,<br/><br/>
  And sinners plunged beneath that flood to lose their guilty stains;<br/><br/>
  And sinners plunged beneath that flood to lose all their guilty stains,<br/><br/>
  And sinners plunged beneath that flood to lose their guilty stains.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Oh celiac fountain, flowing so divine,<br/><br/>
  I came to you one day, all my sins were washed.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Dear dying lamb, thy precious blood shall never lose any power,<br/><br/>
  Till all the ransomed church of God be saved to sin no more;<br/><br/>
  Be saved, to sin no more, be saved // to sin no more//<br/><br/>
  Till all the ransomed church of God be saved to sin no more.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Ever since by faith I saw the stream thy flowing wounds supply,<br/><br/>
  Redeeming love has been my theme and shall be till I die;<br/><br/>
  Ever since by faith I saw the stream thy flowing wounds supply,<br/><br/>
  Redeeming love has been my theme and shall be till I die.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Then in a noble sweeter song I'll sing Thy power to save,<br/><br/>
  When this poor lisping stammering tongue lies silent in the grave;<br/><br/>
  Then in a noble sweeter song I'll sing Thy power to save,<br/><br/>
When this poor lisping stammering tongue lies silent in the grave.</p></center>
