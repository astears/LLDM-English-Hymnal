<center><p>582 A VOICE OVER<br/><br/>
  A voice over this earth has been calling unto us,<br/><br/>
  That Christ Jesus will be coming down from the heavens;<br/><br/>
  With His pow'r He will take up all the faithful,<br/><br/>
  Which He bought, for me it will be great joy, without cease.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Over the heavens, My Lord Christ,<br/><br/>
  With all His power will come down;<br/><br/>
  He will illuminate with light,<br/><br/>
  So I will see Him in glory without a doubt.<br/><br/>
  All of the legions, that will come,<br/><br/>
  Over the heavens so clearly;<br/><br/>
  Giving the news: it's time to go,<br/><br/>
  And all the living things will have their end.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  For in me, all of these glorious heavens,<br/><br/>
  And to see Jesus Christ, in all His beauty;<br/><br/>
  He will come over the heavens with glory,<br/><br/>
  In order to take His faithful church with Him up high.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Sinner come and ask the Lord for forgiveness,<br/><br/>
  May He also give you comfort and calmness;<br/><br/>
  So that righteously you will be living on,<br/><br/>
If in truth you do God's will, He will save your soul.</p></center>
