<center><p>518 WE ARE THE WORKERS OF THE LORD<br/><br/>
  We are the workers of the Lord, with love we're sowing seeds of joy,<br/><br/>
  News of salvation we have preached of Jesus Christ, to him who's lost;<br/><br/>
  Now we are working well with love, with Jesus Christ our Savior Lord,<br/><br/>
  Because He gave His life for souls, and in the Calvary He has died.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Let us now go to reap, the Master's calling,<br/><br/>
  We all should go do some work, tonight and tomorrow;<br/><br/>
  The time's passing in a flash, Brother it will not return,<br/><br/>
  Come you worker come and go to work!<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Let's all go out and preach the Word, to every nation, race, and tribe,<br/><br/>
  And without fear and loyalty, lifting the flag up now today;<br/><br/>
  In all our hands the Lord has placed, this great commission of His love,<br/><br/>
  This news I give you to go preach and all the victory you will have.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Hours and days do quickly pass, the time will never be returned,<br/><br/>
  If you don't preach they will not know, of His apostle and Christ's word;<br/><br/>
  The world is dying without faith, of God's true doctrine to be saved,<br/><br/>
Oh don't despise you this honor that Jesus Christ gives you this day.</p></center>
