<center><p>040 BEFORE THE BREAK OF A DAWNING<br/><br/>
  Before the break of a dawning I do come to you oh Lord,<br/><br/>
  So my soul can find its comfort, and I may carry your cross;<br/><br/>
  You're the gateway towards heaven, where your palace we will find,<br/><br/>
  Serving you is my desire from the bottom of my heart.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  With your hand you will sustain me, till the day you will return,<br/><br/>
  Oh my Lord, my sovereign King, only you can give us life;<br/><br/>
  My soul leaps with jubilation, when I feel that I am blessed,<br/><br/>
  In the nighttime or the daytime, give your holy peace to me.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  I have nothing I can offer, come today and take my heart,<br/><br/>
  For my joy will be to see you, as we reach your holy place;<br/><br/>
  Where you go I'll always follow, with a pure and holy heart,<br/><br/>
You're my only consolation throughout all eternity.</p></center>
