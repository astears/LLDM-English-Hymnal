<center><p>399 OH CHRISTIAN YOUTH<br/><br/>
  Oh Christian youth of Jesus proceed forward,<br/><br/>
  Fighting to save all sinners of this world;<br/><br/>
  Rewards up in the heavens you'll be earning,<br/><br/>
  And you'll reign with the Lord of all Lords in heaven.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Do not allow another to take your crown,<br/><br/>
  Which Jesus has prepared only for you;<br/><br/>
  This will be for all the righteous in glory,<br/><br/>
  When the trumpet blows its final sound.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  If tribulation seems to be fatiguing,<br/><br/>
  All your footsteps the enemy is watching closely;<br/><br/>
  Give one look up to Jesus and instantly,<br/><br/>
  The Lord of Lords will give you consolation.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Together we come to give you an honor,<br/><br/>
  You've been guarded by the grace of Jesus Christ;<br/><br/>
  Who went right from the garden to the Calvary,<br/><br/>
  To wash our sins away up on the cross.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Oh Church of Jesus Christ keep marching forward,<br/><br/>
  Guarded by the grace of Jesus your Lord;<br/><br/>
  And at the end of our lives here on this earth,<br/><br/>
A gold crown of glory we'll receive from Jesus.</p></center>
