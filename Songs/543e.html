<center><p>543 LET US RAISE UP<br/><br/>
  Let us raise up tender songs to the Lord,<br/><br/>
  Hymns that build faith in our souls and our hearts;<br/><br/>
  May they speak highly of His fervent Love,<br/><br/>
  This only lives in the man who believes.<br/><br/>
  Let them come fervently bringing their song,<br/><br/>
  Children and elderly to the altar;<br/><br/>
  Bring unto God, come bring your hearts,<br/><br/>
  The only gift that He will accept.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  //Heavens and earth sing unto the Lord of all the nations//<br/><br/>
  And all men together with their hearts so full of gladness;<br/><br/>
  Let them serve the Lord, for only He gives life and peace.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  He is the fountain of kindness and love,<br/><br/>
  He's life, He's light, and He' is our warmth;<br/><br/>
  He only frees us from anxiety,<br/><br/>
  He only takes pain away from my soul.<br/><br/>
  Therefore He's worthy for man to give Him,<br/><br/>
  Glory and honor that's heard everywhere;<br/><br/>
  Let's go to him, filled with our faith,<br/><br/>
With His great power He will save us.</p></center>
