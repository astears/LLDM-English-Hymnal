<center><p>415 HEAR THE BLESSED SAVIOR<br/><br/>
  Hear the blessed Savior calling the oppressed,<br/><br/>
  &quot;Oh ye heavy laden, come to Me and rest;&quot;<br/><br/>
  Come, no longer tarry, I your load will bear,<br/><br/>
  Bring Me every burden, bring Me every care.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Come unto me, I will give you rest,<br/><br/>
  Take my yoke upon you, hear me and be blessed;<br/><br/>
  I am meek and lowly, come and trust my might,<br/><br/>
  Come, my yoke is easy, and my burden's light.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Are you disappointed, wandering here and there?<br/><br/>
  Dragging chains of doubt and loaded down with care?<br/><br/>
  Do unholy feelings struggle in your breast?<br/><br/>
  Bring your case to Jesus-He will give you rest.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Stumbling on the mountains dark with sin and shame,<br/><br/>
  Stumbling toward the pit of hell's consuming flame;<br/><br/>
  By the powers of sin deluded and oppressed,<br/><br/>
  Hear the tender Shepherd, &quot;Come to me and rest.&quot;<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Have you by temptation often conquered been,<br/><br/>
  Has a sense of weakness brought distress within?<br/><br/>
  Christ will sanctify you, if you'll claim His best,<br/><br/>
In the Holy Spirit, He will give you rest.</p></center>
