I don't know,<br/><br/>  A world with an immense horizon;<br/><br/>  Where I can find His throne that's hidden,<br/><br/>  I will have comfort, I'll have peace.<br/><br/>  CHORUS<br/><br/>  There I will see, His face so lovely,<br/><br/>  There I will see, His marvelous face;<br/><br/>  Following Christ who went before me,<br/><br/>  I will have comfort, I'll have peace.<br/><br/>  2<br/><br/>  A few more years on earth don't matter,<br/><br/>  The time so quickly's passing by;<br/><br/>  His loving face I'll see in the end,<br/><br/>  I will see God's face on His throne.<br/><br/>  3<br/><br/>  I know all life will pass away,<br/><br/>  The flowers past the rivers flourish;<br/><br/>  May happiness defeat our deep pain,<br/><br/>And everything has its own end.</p></center></body></html>
