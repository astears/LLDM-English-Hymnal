  Jesus Christ has saved my soul, praises I will give to Him,<br/><br/>
  In His love I will rejoice and faithful I'll always be;<br/><br/>
  In my soul there's gratitude,<br/><br/>
  For He shed His blood for me one day;<br/><br/>
  To give me His salvation.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  To Jesus Christ, the King of Kings,<br/><br/>
  Let us give honor, forevermore.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  There is great joy in my soul, because Jesus is with me,<br/><br/>
  And He gives me His sweet peace,<br/><br/>
  I will give praise to His name;<br/><br/>
  How happy and jubilant,<br/><br/>
  I feel now with my Lord Jesus Christ;<br/><br/>
  Glory be unto our God.<br/><br/>

  Jesus Christ I want to see, my precious Savior Lord,<br/><br/>
  See the face of my good Lord, who for me gave up His life;<br/><br/>
  I wish to be in His home,<br/><br/>
  Where forever his love reigns with me;<br/><br/>
And rejoice up there with Him.</p></center>
