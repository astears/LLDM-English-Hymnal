<center><p>389 OH HOW BEAUTIFUL<br/><br/>
  Oh how beautiful it is to dwell here,<br/><br/>
  When we are all in one;<br/><br/>
  Because our Jesus sends us life and He blesses us together,<br/><br/>
  And we are all one body here, united now by the Lord;<br/><br/>
  We are waiting for Him to come and take us.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  When Christ comes all the people will then know,<br/><br/>
  That His children we are;<br/><br/>
  If we love one another with our hearts,<br/><br/>
  And if we can be faithful;<br/><br/>
  In the clouds He will return and He will take us with Him,<br/><br/>
  Thousands of years we'll be reigning with Jesus.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Jesus Christ does dwell at the right side of God,<br/><br/>
  In spirit and truth;<br/><br/>
  He is revealing and he's teaching only that which is God's truth,<br/><br/>
  Until the day we all can reach a perfection that's complete;<br/><br/>
  So that when he comes He can take us to His home.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Only one is our good Lord and God,<br/><br/>
  There is no name like His;<br/><br/>
  Only our Jesus who has been, is now, and who will always be,<br/><br/>
  This is why we can tribute praise, to our Savior and King;<br/><br/>
As humans we are worshiping our God.</p></center>
