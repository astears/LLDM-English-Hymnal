<center><p>604 I HAVE BEEN BAPTIZED IN THE NAME<br/><br/>
  I have been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ,<br/><br/>
  // In the name of Jesus Christ//<br/><br/>
  The Lord has made me Holy, by erasing all my sins,<br/><br/>
  Through His bloodshed down on the wooden cross.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Jesus Christ is the name which saves all souls,<br/><br/>
  I have confidence in all His pow'r;<br/><br/>
  So I carry on, faithful on the path,<br/><br/>
  Until I have arrived.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  The name of Jesus is my Savior Lord's dear name,<br/><br/>
  Of His comfort He gives me, when my soul is down and blue;<br/><br/>
  I was wandering in the desert, lost in error and my sins,<br/><br/>
  He will shield me, forgive my soul from sins.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Christ is the beginning, alpha, omega, and the end,<br/><br/>
  He's the first and the last,<br/><br/>
  He's the one who will return;<br/><br/>
  Conforming to our actions,<br/><br/>
  He will have to judge our souls,<br/><br/>
  In that day when the<br/><br/>
  Lord will judge the earth.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Those who are faithful, who complete the will of God,<br/><br/>
  He will give them a reward, and a crown place on their heads;<br/><br/>
  Out of all His mighty greatness, of His grace He will give them,<br/><br/>
  In the Kingdom from times before they'll reign.<br/><br/>
  5<br/><br/>
  All those who are practicing iniquity and sin,<br/><br/>
  And a sentence He will give, in that anger of His;<br/><br/>
  Apart from me you wicked, all you workers of much sin,<br/><br/>
To the fire prepared for you must go.</p></center>
