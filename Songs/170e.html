<center><p>170 JESUS CHRIST IS COMING<br/><br/>
  Jesus Christ is coming on a cloud now,<br/><br/>
  On His throne we all will see His face;<br/><br/>
  He comes surrounded by His holy angels,<br/><br/>
  To lift up all those who suffered for Him.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Oh how joyful to hear the voice of Jesus King,<br/><br/>
  When He tells me to enter my faithful friend;<br/><br/>
  The kingdom now is ready made of pure love,<br/><br/>
  Enter my faithful friend!<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  This day is approaching very quickly,<br/><br/>
  When all peoples will see Christ the Lord;<br/><br/>
  He will appear, He's the King of kings,<br/><br/>
  He will appear with glory and majesty.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  The church of the Lord is now attiring,<br/><br/>
  'Cause they all know how to please their Lord;<br/><br/>
  They will be dressing with the whitest vestments,<br/><br/>
  To accept Christ, their Lord and their King.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Just as a servant faithful to Jesus,<br/><br/>
  He who tells you what you should now do;<br/><br/>
  Look at Jesus who comes to lift all His own,<br/><br/>
And give full payment to this unfaithful world.</p></center>
