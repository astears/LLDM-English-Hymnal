<center><p>288 SO PRECIOUS IS JESUS<br/><br/>
  So precious is Jesus, my Savior, my King,<br/><br/>
  His praise all the daylong with rapture I sing;<br/><br/>
  To Him in my weakness for strength I can cling,<br/><br/>
  For He is so precious to me.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  //For He is so precious, precious //<br/><br/>
  'Tis heaven below, my redeemer to know;<br/><br/>
  For He is so precious to me.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  He stood at my heart's door mid sunshine and rain,<br/><br/>
  And patiently waited an entrance to gain;<br/><br/>
  What shame that so long He entreated in vain,<br/><br/>
  For He is so precious to me.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  I stand on the mountain of blessing at last,<br/><br/>
  No cloud in the heavens a shadow to cast;<br/><br/>
  His smile is upon me, the valley is past,<br/><br/>
  For He is so precious to me.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  I praise Him because he appointed a place,<br/><br/>
  Where some day, through faith in His wonderful grace;<br/><br/>
  I know I shall see Him, shall look on His face,<br/><br/>
For He is so precious to me.</p></center>
