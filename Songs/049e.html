<center><p>049 EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE SO ANGUISHED<br/><br/>
  Even though you are so anguished, it will be your task,<br/><br/>
  To never give up, and always trust in Jesus Christ;<br/><br/>
  //Who will give you liberty//, and protect you from all faults,<br/><br/>
  So that invincible you will be!<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  //I will fight// In Jesus Christ our King,<br/><br/>
  Through Jesus Christ our King;<br/><br/>
  I'll overcome the devil too,<br/><br/>
  //And I will shine inside// that courage in me,<br/><br/>
  Because I'm always ready, to follow through.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  When iniquity calls you, your duty will be,<br/><br/>
  To always reject, all of the dangers around you,<br/><br/>
  //Which can disturb your soul//, that might keep you from the Lord,<br/><br/>
  So invincible you must be.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Through His great love we will challenge, the power of sin,<br/><br/>
  And all errors too, and through the doctrine of Jesus;<br/><br/>
  That will give us all His love, Christ is the way and a light,<br/><br/>
He is a spiritual guide, so you may win a heavenly home!</p></center>
