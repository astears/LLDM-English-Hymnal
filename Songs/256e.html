<center><p>256 RICH BLESSINGS<br/><br/>
  Rich blessings we've come to find, rich blessings we want to feel,<br/><br/>
  We want the joy of salvation, in this congregation.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Glory we're singing to our God on high,<br/><br/>
  Giving Hallelujahs to our Savior Lord.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  To God's church we've made our journey, pillar and ground of the truth,<br/><br/>
  We want the joy of salvation, in the love of Christ our Lord.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  If there's a soul that has feeling, to give to Christ all their heart,<br/><br/>
  Now in this day is the right time, mercy He'll have on your soul.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  The word of God teaches us, to have love in our hearts,<br/><br/>
  This is the key so essential, to reign with Lord Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>
  5<br/><br/>
  Life and salvation we've found, in the word that you have sent us,<br/><br/>
  This is if we congregate and elevate a prayer.<br/><br/>
  6<br/><br/>
  We are so joyful in God's church, pillar and ground of the truth,<br/><br/>
But we'll feel a joy much greater, when souls come and worship Him.</p></center>
