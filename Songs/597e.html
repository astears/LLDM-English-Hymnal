<center><p>597 AS A PRISONER<br/><br/>
  As a prisoner sunk in an abyss,<br/><br/>
  And they said I would never leave that place;<br/><br/>
  When Lord Jesus heard of all my groaning,<br/><br/>
  To them He said: This lost soul is mine.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Jesus Christ in His love freed me,<br/><br/>
  Glory to Him//Amen//<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  In the prison the devil said to me,<br/><br/>
  That he wanted to kill all mankind;<br/><br/>
  When the Lord Jesus heard all my groaning,<br/><br/>
  And Christ told me:<br/><br/>
  I come to save your soul.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Oh how glorious that life is with Jesus,<br/><br/>
  Giving praises and singing to God;<br/><br/>
  And be saying by grace I have been saved,<br/><br/>
  I 'm singing with great jubilation.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  This church is of the Lord Jesus Christ,<br/><br/>
  Jesus Christ said that He would return;<br/><br/>
  Here in this church are all of those convicts,<br/><br/>
Christ freed them, may they proclaim joyfully.</p></center>
