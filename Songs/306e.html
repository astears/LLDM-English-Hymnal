<center><p>306 MAY PEACE BE WITH YOU<br/><br/>
  May peace be with you, from God our Father,<br/><br/>
  You are so valiant, oh Man of God;<br/><br/>
  Because your enemy you have challenged,<br/><br/>
  And at the head of battle you go.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  They're passengers, they're only pilgrims,<br/><br/>
  They are the foreigners of that high land;<br/><br/>
  We have come Brother, to give you greetings,<br/><br/>
  And we do hope that joy fills your heart.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Your face is glowing, shining so brightly,<br/><br/>
  And so magnificent is your heart;<br/><br/>
  We have come Brother, to give you greetings,<br/><br/>
  And we do hope that you're feeling joy.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  This day that God made, it is so pleasant,<br/><br/>
  You are rejoicing deep in your heart;<br/><br/>
  All of your children also are wanting,<br/><br/>
Some of the blessing, God's given you.</p></center>
