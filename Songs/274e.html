<center><p>274 JEHOVAH IS MY GOD<br/><br/>
  Jehovah is my God, He who reigns in all my heart and soul,<br/><br/>
  Temptation you have freed from my soul, and from all the dangers too;<br/><br/>
  And now I only want to live in holiness, humility,<br/><br/>
  Because you are my God, jealous in your love.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Hosannas we sing to the one who reigns in all of our hearts,<br/><br/>
  Your praises we give you 'cause He's freed our souls from hell;<br/><br/>
  And now happily going, to God singing a song, with much love,<br/><br/>
  To where He is awaiting with all of His heart.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Joyously my soul is, glorified in the Lord God,<br/><br/>
  Through your loving kindness to our souls He gives;<br/><br/>
  I'm praying constantly to the Lord with my heart,<br/><br/>
He answers me 'cause He isn't weak and He loves me so.</p></center>
