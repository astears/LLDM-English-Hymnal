<center><p>043 IN THE EARLY HOURS<br/><br/>
  In the early hours of sweet happy mornings,<br/><br/>
  The fragrance of flowers perfume your great throne;<br/><br/>
  The pleas and the prayers of the people, who love you,<br/><br/>
  And sweet hymns of glory proclaiming your love.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Christians also worship and praise God, To you my greatest King;<br/><br/>
  To you we give all the glory for your great love,<br/><br/>
  To you mightiest King of all,<br/><br/>
  To you my loving God.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  In the early hours of sweet happy mornings,<br/><br/>
  The happiest souls give you praises oh Lord;<br/><br/>
  Of rich zestful fragrance and sweet smelling perfume,<br/><br/>
  Are all of the prayers and the sweetest hymns.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  I laid down to rest, went to sleep, and awakened,<br/><br/>
  Because God's dear hands sustained me all night;<br/><br/>
  That's why this great day I do sing and give praises,<br/><br/>
  To the blessed name of my Savior and Lord.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Blessed be the name of my dear Jesus Christ,<br/><br/>
  Who gives us His hand and protects us from sin;<br/><br/>
  He who with His power sustains our souls,<br/><br/>
This is why we give praise to my greatest Lord.</p></center>
