<center><p>527 I'M A SOLDIER OF JESUS<br/><br/>
  I'm a soldier of Jesus, of Christ my Savior Lord,<br/><br/>
  I will fight for my Lord, in the battle of the faith;<br/><br/>
  With my eyes on the Lord, only Jesus my Captain,<br/><br/>
  I will fight against Satan and his hosts.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Hear the voice of Jesus, who is calling,<br/><br/>
  //Unto the battle//<br/><br/>
  Oh hear the voice of Jesus He who tells us,<br/><br/>
  Who today is going to fight?<br/><br/>
  I am a soldier of Lord Christ Jesus,<br/><br/>
  And through faith,<br/><br/>
  I'm going to win the war;<br/><br/>
  I am a soldier of Lord Christ Jesus,<br/><br/>
  And the triumph and victory I will have.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  The word of the Lord is the sword of a great faith,<br/><br/>
  That which helps me to fight, for my Savior Jesus Christ;<br/><br/>
  I will fight, gloriously, with the troops of Jesus Christ,<br/><br/>
  Today you will see me fighting fearlessly.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Don't you want to come follow,<br/><br/>
  Christ your Savior and Lord?<br/><br/>
  And to fight now for Him, in the battle of the faith?<br/><br/>
  If you're faithful to Christ, a crown He will place on you,<br/><br/>
  And with Him you will have felicity.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Very soon, I know well, all my struggles will then cease,<br/><br/>
  And with Jesus Christ Lord, we will reign with Him on high;<br/><br/>
  Oh what blessing divine, to live with Jesus Christ on high,<br/><br/>
Where there is no more sadness, nor sorrow.</p></center>
