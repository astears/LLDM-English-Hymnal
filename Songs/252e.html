<center><p>252 THERE IS A TREASURE<br/><br/>
  There is a treasure stored for me up in the heavens,<br/><br/>
  That many sinners have been hoping to gain;<br/><br/>
  And walking through the many thorns, thistles, and needles,<br/><br/>
  A rich treasurer more than diamonds I will gain.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Although there's a dangerous storm disrupting my path,<br/><br/>
  That so cruelly does beat on my dear soul;<br/><br/>
  But I anxiously await to see the rainbow,<br/><br/>
  That's announcing forever a sweet peace.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  It is a palace of great beauty I do seek,<br/><br/>
  And it is hidden past the bluish turquoise sky;<br/><br/>
  And it's adorned with shining stars, so very precious,<br/><br/>
  It is a treasure I am looking for my soul.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  There is a precious Prince that's dwelling with my treasure,<br/><br/>
  And I am longing to know Him face to face;<br/><br/>
  Because with His blood my soul has been given freedom,<br/><br/>
  And my life He has changed with His mighty hand.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  He is so loving, affectionate, and so lovely,<br/><br/>
  And in my trials I have tasted His sweet love;<br/><br/>
  And He helps me, and cheers me up when I am saddened,<br/><br/>
Someday forever I will live with Him above.</p></center>
