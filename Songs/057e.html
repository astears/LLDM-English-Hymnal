<center><p>057 BLESSING AND COMMUNION<br/><br/>
  Blessing and communion, is the loveliest divine song,<br/><br/>
  All of those who've been washed, through God's Lamb dwelling on Mount Zion.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  My cups overflowing contemplating all my Brothers,<br/><br/>
  I'm satisfied seeing, all of those washed in the Lord's blood;<br/><br/>
  Oh how joyful, oh it is my contentment,<br/><br/>
  This is what I feel in the Lord's church.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Prayer, communion is joy for the just ones in Christ Jesus,<br/><br/>
  It's the hymn sung by saints, to all those gaining redemption from God.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Salvation, communion, in the church of the live God,<br/><br/>
  He's dispersed His Spirit;<br/><br/>
  With His sweet love to the humble souls.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  In the end there's communion, eternal life, redemption,<br/><br/>
  We'll be dwelling in mansions;<br/><br/>
We will sing praises and honor Christ.</p></center>
