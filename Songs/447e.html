<center><p>447 HOW GREAT IS TO HAVE<br/><br/>
  How great is to have in the soul a remembrance,<br/><br/>
  That we were delivered from misery and sin;<br/><br/>
  For this we sing to Him, a sweet song of joy,<br/><br/>
  A song which inspires great courage to all.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  We sing in sweet harm'ny, united as one,<br/><br/>
  For the Lord has sent, a Servant of God;<br/><br/>
  Who has been anointed and chosen for us all,<br/><br/>
  He brought us together, and has given our souls;<br/><br/>
  The good news of peace.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  How great is to serve, our God and Creator,<br/><br/>
  All anguish has passed, all pain and all grief;<br/><br/>
  All darkness has left us, so light has arrived,<br/><br/>
  Our darkness departed, our Savior prevailed.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  God has compensated all your works of labor,<br/><br/>
  He's blessed you with gifts, with grace, with knowledge;<br/><br/>
  The people ignore, that Jesus sent you,<br/><br/>
May God prosper you, oh Servant of God.</p></center>
