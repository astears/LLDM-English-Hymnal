  Shout for joy to the Lord,<br/><br/>
  All creation, all of the whole earth;<br/><br/>
  Worship the Lord God with gladness,<br/><br/>
  Come before Him with a joyful song, and praises.<br/><br/>
  •••••<br/><br/>
  Know that the Lord is God, He is King, He has made us,<br/><br/>
  And not we ourselves, we belong to Him;<br/><br/>
  We are His people, the sheep of His pasture.<br/><br/>
  •••••<br/><br/>
  With thanksgiving and praise enter unto His gates,<br/><br/>
  And His courts with songs of praises;<br/><br/>
  //Give thanks to Him and praise His name//<br/><br/>
  For the Lord God is good,<br/><br/>
  And His love endures forever,<br/><br/>
His faithfulness continues through all generations, Amen.</p></center>
