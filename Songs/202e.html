<center><p>202 AN APOSTLE GOD HAS SENT<br/><br/>
  An Apostle God has sent from the heavens,<br/><br/>
  Let us not murmur, against the friend of our Lord;<br/><br/>
  For the Church of the Lord has descended again,<br/><br/>
  With Her light brighter more than the moon's;<br/><br/>
  The past maidens are dazzled in awe,<br/><br/>
  She's the wife, the elected of God.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Rejoice, oh blessed Church, beloved of the Lord,<br/><br/>
  All the false-hearted men quiver with fear;<br/><br/>
  For they destroyed the just path of the Lord,<br/><br/>
  The voice of the good Sheppard,<br/><br/>
  His church has come to know;<br/><br/>
  His sheep ignore the calling,<br/><br/>
  Of any stranger, who may lure them with their voice.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  I am God who commanded destruction,<br/><br/>
  Against these men: Korah, Dathan, and Abiram;<br/><br/>
  For they thought their perception much wiser than Mine,<br/><br/>
  And rejected the man, I chose then;<br/><br/>
  They were once chosen people of God,<br/><br/>
  But erased were their names from God's book.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Be not severed from the path of the Lord,<br/><br/>
  By being spiteful, and not releasing your bitterness;<br/><br/>
  Your within Israel, a great people of peace,<br/><br/>
  Israel whom I've loved since its birth;<br/><br/>
  Never question My words and decrees,<br/><br/>
They form pathways that lead up to Me.</p></center>
