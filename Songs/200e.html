<center><p>200 YOUR AN APOSTLE OF GOD<br/><br/>
  Your an Apostle of God, by the order of the Lord,<br/><br/>
  So that you guide the Lord's people, that the Lord has given you;<br/><br/>
  When Aaron your father slept, he had left you with an order,<br/><br/>
  //May you guard all of God's people, until Jesus comes again//<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  We remember the past moment, when we were greatly afflicted,<br/><br/>
  We thought that we'd be alone, without a Servant of the Lord;<br/><br/>
  But my God who is so loving, sent a blessing to His flock,<br/><br/>
  //We are joyful in our beings, to see Jesus shine in you//<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  We have promised our dear Lord, to be faithful till the end,<br/><br/>
  We remember all of the counsels, that his servant left us here;<br/><br/>
  With our hands raised towards the heavens, we promise to serve you Lord<br/><br/>
  //And have promised to be faithful to gain blessed salvation//<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  You're a Servant of the Lord, your place is special from God,<br/><br/>
  Because the Lord did give you, and He did see in your heart;<br/><br/>
  We are all here reunited, also listening to your counsels,<br/><br/>
//We will guard them in our hearts, and walk in them forever//</p></center>
