<center><p>422 PEACE GRACE AND LOVE<br/><br/>
  Peace, grace, and love is what we will partake in,<br/><br/>
  The Servant of God, by our Jesus Christ;<br/><br/>
  On this day of much joy, the children of light,<br/><br/>
  We give a kiss of love;<br/><br/>
  Glory to God for His grace, He who gave you liberty.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  The Lord has given you a crown,<br/><br/>
  He gave you a valiant people;<br/><br/>
  So they may keep on announcing,<br/><br/>
  The gospel of our Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  A man of war you are and you've won the battle,<br/><br/>
  By your faith in our Jesus Christ;<br/><br/>
  He's the one who raised Thee, as a bright torch,<br/><br/>
  So that you may be shining;<br/><br/>
  As you're teaching of God's truth, to all of humanity.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Christ has given you the power over this earth,<br/><br/>
  That you may free souls stranded in the dark;<br/><br/>
  So you may give them life, through Jesus Christ,<br/><br/>
  The almighty Savior;<br/><br/>
With much fervor we will sing, giving glories to the Lord.</p></center>
