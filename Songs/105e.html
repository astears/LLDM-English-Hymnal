<center><p>105 JESUS CHRIST IS LOOKING<br/><br/>
  Jesus Christ is looking for laborers,<br/><br/>
  Who wants to go with Him?<br/><br/>
  Who will say, oh Lord,<br/><br/>
  I will go with you?<br/><br/>
  I want to serve you true!<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Oh my Lord, the harvest is so great,<br/><br/>
  But laborers are few;<br/><br/>
  Give us light, a burning faith, and strength,<br/><br/>
  And laborers there'll be.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Jesus Christ would like some missioners too,<br/><br/>
  Announcing all His truth;<br/><br/>
  Who will say, oh Lord I'm ready to go?<br/><br/>
  I'll only do your will.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  There's a room if you would like to work,<br/><br/>
  In part of Jesus' work;<br/><br/>
  Can you to the world speak of the Lord's love,<br/><br/>
  Of His mercy and love.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Daily are you living saved in Christ?<br/><br/>
  You've already felt His love;<br/><br/>
  Speak you then announce that in Jesus' light,<br/><br/>
You have been living well.</p></center>
