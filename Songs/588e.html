<center><p>588 THE GREAT DAY OF THE LORD<br/><br/>
  The great day of the Lord's drawing near,<br/><br/>
  Words that Jesus announced when He was preaching;<br/><br/>
  That He would come in clouds from the heavens,<br/><br/>
  To carry His church that is beloved and blessed.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Oh my Christ Jesus Lord, when you come down for last time,<br/><br/>
  Do not leave me here my Lord, have compassion on my dear soul;<br/><br/>
  That's been bought by your shed blood,<br/><br/>
  Take me to eternal rest so I can be close to my Lord.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  The great day of the Lord's drawing near,<br/><br/>
  Christ announced though despised and with heartaches;<br/><br/>
  That He would come in clouds from the heavens,<br/><br/>
  With His greatness, His power, and also His fire.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  This whole world is not ready for Christ,<br/><br/>
  For His coming nor the torment they will suffer;<br/><br/>
  To have lived without God but in their sins,<br/><br/>
  In the end God won't save all the ones of rebellion.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  The great day of the Lord's drawing near,<br/><br/>
  That which Jesus Christ taught to all His children;<br/><br/>
  After He would take all of His people,<br/><br/>
Many plagues God will send as He did in Egypt.</p></center>
