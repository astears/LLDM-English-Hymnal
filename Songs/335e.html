<center><p>335 MASTER GIVE HEED TO MY PRAYER<br/><br/>
  Master give heed to my prayer,<br/><br/>
  And lis't my constricted heart;<br/><br/>
  Ineffable tears of my soul,<br/><br/>
  Are shed as I see the lies.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  The false teachers consent to all sin and strife,<br/><br/>
  //without remorse// But when King Jesus returns to earth,<br/><br/>
  //They'll be repaid// And then they will repent from sin,<br/><br/>
  Because the Lord swiftly will strike them then;<br/><br/>
  Excuses He will not hear again //Soon He will come//<br/><br/>
  He'll pay all men for their sin and strife, He will come soon.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Sleeveless and unfitted clothing,<br/><br/>
  Are unpleasant to the Lord; Fashion rings, necklaces, pearls,<br/><br/>
  Are all against piety. 3 With perms and ostentatious hair-dos,<br/><br/>
  The young and the old adorn;<br/><br/>
  Oh teachers consent to these actions,<br/><br/>
  In hell the will see their end.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  All women who journey with Jesus,<br/><br/>
  Are filled with God's piety;<br/><br/>
  Humbling, modestly living,<br/><br/>
  Giving fruits of sanctity.<br/><br/>
  5<br/><br/>
  False teachers proclaim they are living,<br/><br/>
  In truth and in holiness;<br/><br/>
  Their teaching of error and blunder,<br/><br/>
  Confirms they are blind as well.<br/><br/>
  6<br/><br/>
  False teachers who preach of God's doctrine,<br/><br/>
  And speak of the word of God;<br/><br/>
  Allowing the people to falter,<br/><br/>
By tricking humanity.</p></center>
