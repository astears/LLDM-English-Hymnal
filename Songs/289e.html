<center><p>289 JESUS FOUNDED A CHURCH<br/><br/>
  Jesus founded a Church and it will be known to all,<br/><br/>
  By fruits and other signals, the masses will then see;<br/><br/>
  Its name is in the Bible, and two cannot be found,<br/><br/>
  Apostle Paul does teach us, that it's the Church of God.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  The church of the Lord may it always reign,<br/><br/>
  Because it's arriving, all over the world;<br/><br/>
  And then it will rise, holding its banner,<br/><br/>
  Because the one who's guiding, is an Apostle of the Lord.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  The Church is marching onwards, to the celestial place,<br/><br/>
  Guided by an Apostle, who's Servant of our God;<br/><br/>
  Give glories without ceasing, to our Savior and Lord,<br/><br/>
  His love is so immense that He's cleansed us from our sins.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  He comes to take the one, and it's the Church of God,<br/><br/>
  To His holy bosom, to the great city;<br/><br/>
  And His beloved wife, that He will surely crown,<br/><br/>
For all that she has suffered, for his holy name.</p></center>
