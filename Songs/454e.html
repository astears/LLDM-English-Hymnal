<center><p>454 WHO IS HE THAT COMES FROM EDOM?<br/><br/>
  Who is he that comes from Edom?<br/><br/>
  His attire is all red; I can see His hands are punctured,<br/><br/>
  And His side is cruelly hurt.<br/><br/>
  Who's this man of many burdens?<br/><br/>
  The one that is badly hurt;<br/><br/>
  Tell me why have they disfigured,<br/><br/>
  His beautiful noble face?<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  It is Jesus, the King of glory,<br/><br/>
  With His death He ransomed me;<br/><br/>
  Come to worship and proclaim Him,<br/><br/>
  He's our Prince He is our Lord.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Who is He that's bearing disdain,<br/><br/>
  On the winepress walked alone?<br/><br/>
  By all men He was forgotten,<br/><br/>
  No consolation for Him.<br/><br/>
  When in anguish and affliction,<br/><br/>
  No complaint was heard from Him;<br/><br/>
  Like a lamb to death departed,<br/><br/>
  He was mute up till His death.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  He is wearing a King's garment,<br/><br/>
  And a crown He bears it's true;<br/><br/>
  But it's not golden its of thorns,<br/><br/>
  And His scepter's but a stick.<br/><br/>
  Why do they mock Him so coldly?<br/><br/>
  And they whip Him without fear;<br/><br/>
  In His kind face they are spitting,<br/><br/>
  Perhaps He was a convict?<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Who is this man in the summit,<br/><br/>
  Of the Calvary He died?<br/><br/>
  He prayed for His enemies there,<br/><br/>
  He forgives their wickedness.<br/><br/>
  Still the earth shakes and it trembles,<br/><br/>
  And its clouds cover the sun;<br/><br/>
  As His head inclines before them,<br/><br/>
And to God He gives His soul.</p></center>
