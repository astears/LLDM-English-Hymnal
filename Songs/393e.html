<center><p>393 OH LOFTY GRACE<br/><br/>
  Oh lofty grace that comes from our God,<br/><br/>
  Grace that the messenger can convey;<br/><br/>
  When he goes planting in this dead world,<br/><br/>
  The living seed that's born from His love.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  ///Go/// planter go<br/><br/>
  /// Go/// Brother, go!<br/><br/>
  Go plant the living seed on earth, //go// planter go.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  If your pathway seems so difficult,<br/><br/>
  Know that the promise of God is true;<br/><br/>
  With my right hand I'll be aiding thee,<br/><br/>
  I will be faithful in helping you.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  If you're not asked to go preach the word,<br/><br/>
  You should still do what you can to help;<br/><br/>
  Your Father who's watching secretly,<br/><br/>
  He will be there to reward your deeds.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  If you are humble as Ruth once was,<br/><br/>
  Go to fields and perform your task;<br/><br/>
  Surely you will find ones left behind,<br/><br/>
  That other workers forgot to sow.<br/><br/>
  5<br/><br/>
  Not only preaching and singing hymns,<br/><br/>
  Will save the souls from perdition here;<br/><br/>
  But he who lives in holiness,<br/><br/>
  Will compel others to come to God.<br/><br/>
  6<br/><br/>
  Plant in all places the love of Christ,<br/><br/>
  For every planter will have His prize;<br/><br/>
  Those who are planting with tears and love,<br/><br/>
  They will be reaping with love up there.<br/><br/>
  7<br/><br/>
  The time of sowing is ending soon,<br/><br/>
  Soon we'll be resting with Jesus Christ;<br/><br/>
  We will see the souls who have been saved,<br/><br/>
Shining above just as precious jewels.</p></center>
