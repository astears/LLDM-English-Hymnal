<center><p>205 MY FRIEND IS JESUS<br/><br/>
  My friend is Jesus the best friend I have,<br/><br/>
  Tender and loving, none other like Him;<br/><br/>
  All of my life I will rest in his love,<br/><br/>
  Only in Him I will be secure.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Oh my friend Jesus! Closer to you,<br/><br/>
  Your pathway firmly I want to walk;<br/><br/>
  Only I want you to reign in me,<br/><br/>
  I want to live in your holy grace.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  When I'm in trials He's closer to me,<br/><br/>
  He gives me strength and the will to move on;<br/><br/>
  Never forgotten I'll be with my Lord,<br/><br/>
  Never will I be without His love.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  He gives me light, when I start to doubt,<br/><br/>
  He guides the pathway in which I will walk;<br/><br/>
  I owe all my life to Lord Jesus Christ,<br/><br/>
  Only through Him, I have life to live.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  He is my guide like a Shepherd to sheep,<br/><br/>
  He leads my life through the ways of His peace;<br/><br/>
  He rescues me from whatever I fear,<br/><br/>
Giving me joy to see His face.</p></center>
