<center><p>175 THE OLD RUGGED CROSS<br/><br/>
  On a hill far away, stood an old rugged cross,<br/><br/>
  The emblem of suffering and shame;<br/><br/>
  And I love that old cross, where the dearest and best,<br/><br/>
  For a world of lost sinners was slain.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Oh, I'll cherish the one on the cross,<br/><br/>
  Till my trophies at last I lay down;<br/><br/>
  I will cling to the old rugged cross,<br/><br/>
  And exchange it someday for a crown.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Oh, the cross of my Lord, so despised by the world,<br/><br/>
  There's a wondrous attraction for me;<br/><br/>
  For the dear Lamb of God, left His glory above,<br/><br/>
  Giving up His own life, to save me.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  In the old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,<br/><br/>
  A wondrous beauty I see;<br/><br/>
  He was nailed to the cross, where He suffered and died,<br/><br/>
  To pardon and to sanctify me.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  To my Lord Jesus Christ, I will ever be true,<br/><br/>
  If shame and reproach gladly bear;<br/><br/>
  Then He'll call me someday, to my home far away,<br/><br/>
Where His glory forever I'll share.</p></center>
