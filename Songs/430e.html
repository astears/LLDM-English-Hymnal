<center><p>430 BECAUSE OF THE AMAZING<br/><br/>
  Because of the amazing daylight,<br/><br/>
  That comes to give my heart such joy;<br/><br/>
  As we awaken every morning,<br/><br/>
  When we admire all the warmth;<br/><br/>
  Of a bright dawning with its beauty,<br/><br/>
  Let us give thanks unto our God!<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  For the aroma the flowers,<br/><br/>
  Where in their colored finery;<br/><br/>
  We see the mighty hand of our God,<br/><br/>
  That with His stencil gave them hue;<br/><br/>
  For many, many wondrous marvels,<br/><br/>
  Let us give thanks unto our God!<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Because our daily bread He gives us,<br/><br/>
  This He has granted us with love;<br/><br/>
  So tireless so good and holy,<br/><br/>
  To all creation He conveys;<br/><br/>
  Because this daily bread gives us life,<br/><br/>
  Let us give thanks unto our God!<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  And for the roof giving protection,<br/><br/>
  And for His holy blessing too;<br/><br/>
  And for the life of our parents,<br/><br/>
  Who gave us to the Lord with love;<br/><br/>
  For all those precious things He gives us,<br/><br/>
  Let us give thanks unto our God!<br/><br/>
  5<br/><br/>
  From the Lord's amazing knowledge,<br/><br/>
  Intelligence He gave to us;<br/><br/>
  So that we may think of His glory,<br/><br/>
  As beautiful wings spread with love;<br/><br/>
  Because of that wonderful privilege,<br/><br/>
  Let us give thanks unto our God!<br/><br/>
  6<br/><br/>
  Because of that distinguished honor,<br/><br/>
  Which in His kindness He dispensed;<br/><br/>
  Sending His sacrosanct Son to us,<br/><br/>
  To consummate our redemption;<br/><br/>
  For all the humans who are sinners,<br/><br/>
Let us give thanks unto our God!</p></center>
