<center><p>473 VALIENTLY LEAVE<br/><br/>
  Valiantly leave, oh battalion of Israel,<br/><br/>
  Sing of the triumph, and the victory through faith;<br/><br/>
  Oh you the youth your seed is in Lord Jesus Christ,<br/><br/>
  Eternal rocks of all the centuries, it's so firm.<br/><br/>
  Oh burst and shout in voices loud to praise the Lord,<br/><br/>
  The evangel of God's love and justice too;<br/><br/>
  The message to the souls you will take to the world,<br/><br/>
  The souls are begging to be freed from Satan's yoke.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  All the troops of Jesus Christ have been prepared for,<br/><br/>
  To fight strong against satan;<br/><br/>
  All the soldiers look so valiant when they're marching,<br/><br/>
  Holding up high all their swords.<br/><br/>
  Although bloodshed from the martyrs it has cost us,<br/><br/>
  This blood will be left shed o'er the fields;<br/><br/>
  In the trenches, it has been sealed,<br/><br/>
  The evangel will always be left.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Celestial shocks of all the angels of the Lord,<br/><br/>
  They will be help for all the soldiers of Christ;<br/><br/>
  When in the war Jehovah's justice does prevail,<br/><br/>
  Without cease going towards the front guard, they will go.<br/><br/>
  The light of dawning will be seen with clarity,<br/><br/>
  And with Jehovah in His glory I will go;<br/><br/>
  When you invoke Lord Jesus name,<br/><br/>
  He's always there,<br/><br/>
  For your response and love I'll go with you my Christ.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  March on with valor to fight against all your foes,<br/><br/>
  Oh you the youth without vacillating, advance;<br/><br/>
  The voice of a warrior resounding in every place,<br/><br/>
  All of the demons and the devil will be vexed.<br/><br/>
  Detain the sun if you are ready to prevail,<br/><br/>
  Just as Joshua through grace and also faith;<br/><br/>
  Through his command the sun so soon obeyed his voice,<br/><br/>
It is your duty to fight for Lord Jesus Christ.</p></center>
