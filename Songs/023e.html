<center><p>023 SOME PEOPLE SING<br/><br/>
  Some people sing, to please all of humanity,<br/><br/>
  And others sing to pass away a boring time;<br/><br/>
  But with great faith I sing to my dear Lord,<br/><br/>
  //He's in my soul//<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Inside my soul lives the great melody of love,<br/><br/>
  He's in my soul; for I belong to Christ my Lord;<br/><br/>
  He's in my soul, that's why I sing with all my heart,<br/><br/>
  //He's in my soul//<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  I know that Jesus with His blood has cleansed my soul,<br/><br/>
  I know that Jesus lives forever in my heart;<br/><br/>
  And through his Servant, God has chosen me,<br/><br/>
//He's in my soul//</p></center>
