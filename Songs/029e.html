<center><p>029 OH I WISH TO BE SERVING THE LORD<br/><br/>
  Oh I wish to be serving the Lord,<br/><br/>
  For I know He will save me from sin;<br/><br/>
  He has promised to lead till the end,<br/><br/>
  For I know that the Lord will save me.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  I have fought in the battle oh Lord,<br/><br/>
  I will fight to the end of my career;<br/><br/>
  I have also maintained firm my faith,<br/><br/>
  I await you to take me away.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  In this world I will have to survive,<br/><br/>
  With all those not possessing a faith;<br/><br/>
  Being born as a child of my God,<br/><br/>
  I wish never to abandon His love.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  All the things I may have to endure,<br/><br/>
  They will never compare to His light;<br/><br/>
  With the glory of Christ when He comes,<br/><br/>
  To the faithful He will then impart.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Royal crown is awaiting for all,<br/><br/>
  Who will fight till the end of their days;<br/><br/>
  Given then by the Lord; fairest judge,<br/><br/>
In the day when He makes His return.</p></center>
