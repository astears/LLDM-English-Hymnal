<center><p>246 THERE IS A LIGHT<br/><br/>
  There is a light illuminating darkness,<br/><br/>
  It is Christ's gospel that He came to impart;<br/><br/>
  Blessing the heart with peace and ridding it from evil,<br/><br/>
  All those who once were wandering have now been found.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  It is the teaching of Christ our Savior Lord,<br/><br/>
  Brought from the heavens to fill our hearts with peace;<br/><br/>
  So that the wandering soul may find through Jesus Christ, Life,<br/><br/>
  Truth, Salvation, also liberty.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  There is a light descending from the heavens,<br/><br/>
  Illuminating more than the sun of day;<br/><br/>
  Giving the sinner, peace, joy, comfort to their souls,<br/><br/>
  All those who once were wandering have now been found.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Your word to me is light guiding my pathway,<br/><br/>
  And in my journey your teaching lights my way;<br/><br/>
  It penetrates and rids the dross in minds and hearts,<br/><br/>
  All those who once were wandering have now been found.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  I saw an angel coming down from heaven,<br/><br/>
  A great Apostle called by the God of love;<br/><br/>
  Holding a scroll with news to use in His great mission,<br/><br/>
It was the gospel of Brother Aaron.</p></center>
