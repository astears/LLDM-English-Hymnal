<center><p>609 I GO TO JESUS<br/><br/>
  I go to Jesus, my Savior and my King,<br/><br/>
  And I'm presenting kneeled at His feet all my heart;<br/><br/>
  He that does knoweth all intentions of man,<br/><br/>
  He does forgive me, and gives me His blessing too.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Awake oh beloved soul from all your mortal dreams here,<br/><br/>
  Look because when the Lord comes He will not save your soul;<br/><br/>
  If you then persist in sinning and profess all wickedness,<br/><br/>
  In the coming of Christ Jesus your soul He will separate.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  As a bird my soul, flew far away from snares,<br/><br/>
  Terrible traps that the hunter had set up;<br/><br/>
  But in a moment, Christ came to rescue me,<br/><br/>
  From all the snares, Christ gave me liberty.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  I know am saved through, the grace of our God,<br/><br/>
  I feel so joyful, profoundly I feel His peace;<br/><br/>
  My innocent soul escaped from all those snares,<br/><br/>
Only though Jesus, from snares I've been saved.</p></center>
