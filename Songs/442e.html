<center><p>442 OH WHAT BLISS MY SOUL FEELS<br/><br/>
  Oh what bliss my soul feels when I come here to greet you,<br/><br/>
  From many distant nations we all have come in love;<br/><br/>
  Another year of life which the Lord has given to you,<br/><br/>
  May He prolong your life here for the good of us all.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Your enemies have slandered and will always denounce you,<br/><br/>
  As Jesus up in Calvary, the martyr 'cause He loved;<br/><br/>
  No one has ever answered the doctrine God revealed you,<br/><br/>
  Most blessed friend Jesus, ambassador of God.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  No one can recompense all your sacred works of labor,<br/><br/>
  No one can parallel your persistence in your work;<br/><br/>
  An offering we now bring, please receive it from your children,<br/><br/>
  And pray to God the Father, to give us blessings more.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  We're all here reunited, to hear your words of wisdom,<br/><br/>
  For most divine blessings flow from you like a stream;<br/><br/>
  And fortified with faith we return home to our dwellings,<br/><br/>
  And tell the world forever: Servant you are of God.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  What privilege we have to have known a Man so holy,<br/><br/>
  To have received you as the Apostle of our God;<br/><br/>
  We ask that you remember us when you speak to Jesus,<br/><br/>
And put us in God hands so we all can persevere.</p></center>
