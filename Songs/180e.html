<center><p>180 ON THIS GREAT MEMORABLE DAY<br/><br/>
  On this great memorable day,<br/><br/>
  We have all heard your sweet voice;<br/><br/>
  As we all come to salute thee,<br/><br/>
  Anointed of our Lord.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Oh Anointed, elected Servant,<br/><br/>
  Here in your presence we witness;<br/><br/>
  What with your hands you have labored,<br/><br/>
  All the hardships that you have carried;<br/><br/>
  They have not been trampled over,<br/><br/>
  You have been blessed by God.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  All the false Christians ignore,<br/><br/>
  He who has elected thee;<br/><br/>
  Your congregation does know this,<br/><br/>
  It was revealed by our God.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Just as the wise men had journeyed,<br/><br/>
  Bringing gifts for their dear King;<br/><br/>
  So does the Church now give offerings,<br/><br/>
  Because you are our King.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  This humble offering we give thee,<br/><br/>
  And we all ask for your prayer;<br/><br/>
  May you plead in all our favor,<br/><br/>
You are the friend of our God.</p></center>
