<center><p>173 IN JESUS CHRIST MY SOUL IS HAPPY<br/><br/>
  In Jesus Christ my soul is happy,<br/><br/>
  Precious is His celestial gift;<br/><br/>
  His voice returns calmness to me,<br/><br/>
  His face forgives me of my sin.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  //I do rejoice with Him//<br/><br/>
  His joy and His peace;<br/><br/>
  Are flooding my soul,<br/><br/>
  Well, I do rejoice in him.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  A long time ago He did find me,<br/><br/>
  He brought me to His blessed church;<br/><br/>
  In His arms of love I was taken,<br/><br/>
  Where thousands of fortunes I found.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  His paternal love does surround me,<br/><br/>
  His grace can now comfort my soul;<br/><br/>
  I'm flooded by His Holy Spirit,<br/><br/>
  It's a strange and powerful might.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Someday I will be like His image,<br/><br/>
  When I leave this body behind;<br/><br/>
  Meanwhile as a faithful disciple,<br/><br/>
I would like to be till the end.</p></center>
