<center><p>269 CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST<br/><br/>
  Church of Jesus Christ may you be now encouraged,<br/><br/>
  Do not fear may you never be embarrassed;<br/><br/>
  Enlarge all the spaces in your houses,<br/><br/>
  Because the Saint of Israel is your grand helper.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Pitiful church, you were fatigued, without comfort,<br/><br/>
  With His justice, the Lord Jesus rescued you;<br/><br/>
  If anyone conspires against you Church,<br/><br/>
  They will always fall to the ground.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Time ago the church was a lonely widow,<br/><br/>
  But you were restored, redeemed from God's mercy;<br/><br/>
  The Saint of Israel made a pact and said,<br/><br/>
  I won't be mad, says the Lord, never again.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  He calls you, all the predestined so blessed,<br/><br/>
  The queens and all the maidens give you glories;<br/><br/>
  From the concubines you were sent my dove,<br/><br/>
  God has told you: &quot;You are my dove, Israel.&quot;<br/><br/>
  2nd. CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Pitiful church, you were fatigued, without comfort,<br/><br/>
  But I will have compassion eternally;<br/><br/>
  For a time, time, and half time I left you,<br/><br/>
  But now with great love,<br/><br/>
I have picked you up my dove.</p></center>
