<center><p>312 THE VICTORY IS GAINED<br/><br/>
  Victory is gained through Jesus, in the true church of the Lord,<br/><br/>
  Enemies are being conquered through our Savior Jesus Christ;<br/><br/>
  With jubilee, singing contently, On this day we bless God's name.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Just as the dawning grows in the morning,<br/><br/>
  So is the true Church of our Lord;<br/><br/>
  //Growing in works and grace abundantly,<br/><br/>
  Until perfect someday she will be//<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Many are the concubines, who are waiting for His love,<br/><br/>
  Yet one dove belongs to me, said the wise King Solomon;<br/><br/>
  It's the true church of our Lord, Who awaits for Him in love.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  It's the true church of our Lord, with two wings she flew away,<br/><br/>
  Into the desert where she was cared for, for a time, times, half a time;<br/><br/>
  But now she has reappeared, And rejoicing with her Lord.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  You are beautiful my darling, most beloved of our Lord,<br/><br/>
  Dressed in garments of fine linen, waiting for Him to appear;<br/><br/>
Like fine spices and a garden, Your aroma fills my heart.</p></center>
