<center><p>199 ONE HUNDRED WERE COUNTED<br/><br/>
  One hundred were counted,<br/><br/>
  lambs of the Shepherd's flock,<br/><br/>
  One hundred were counted,<br/><br/>
  He took them with love;<br/><br/>
  But then one sad evening,<br/><br/>
  He began to count them,<br/><br/>
  //Surely one was missing// and sadly He cried.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Ninety-nine He left there, in the flock behind Him,<br/><br/>
  Through the mountains searching, the Shepherd went on;<br/><br/>
  Then He found her weeping, trembling cold and lonely,<br/><br/>
  //Her wounds he anointed// and took her back home.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  So this same old story, is being repeated,<br/><br/>
  There are still sheep missing, wandering all alone;<br/><br/>
  Wandering in this world, nowhere near the flock,<br/><br/>
//Without God or love// without forgiveness.</p></center>
