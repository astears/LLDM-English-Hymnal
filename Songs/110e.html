<center><p>110 AS IF IT WERE SUN OF DAY<br/><br/>
  As if it were sun of day,<br/><br/>
  And even more brightly shinning;<br/><br/>
  Splendor has come into our hearts, to increase our understanding,<br/><br/>
  Oh what blessed light of Savior Jesus Christ;<br/><br/>
  Oh divine Christ Jesus Lord,<br/><br/>
  You are our redeemer Lord.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  This light is shining in the church of our Lord,<br/><br/>
  Because Jesus Christ Lord, gave us the Counselor;<br/><br/>
  From His Spirit filled with graces,<br/><br/>
  This is the might of our God;<br/><br/>
  That is why your people do praise thee,<br/><br/>
  'Cause of your great love.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Now with joy and gratitude,<br/><br/>
  Your people are reunited;<br/><br/>
  Joyful because of the health, from Jesus we've received,<br/><br/>
  Guard us now oh Lord, in holy communion;<br/><br/>
  Walking onward, all united, so we may enter your home.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Through your spirit full of light,<br/><br/>
  That you've conveyed to your people;<br/><br/>
  Jesus Christ has now been preached, to the man who was a wandering,<br/><br/>
  Call them to you Lord, bring them closer to you;<br/><br/>
  Give them life now, oh Christ Jesus,<br/><br/>
To those who you will redeem.</p></center>
