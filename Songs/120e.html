<center><p>120 AS I'M READING IN THE BIBLE<br/><br/>
  As I'm reading in the Bible how the Lord talks to us,<br/><br/>
  And he blesses the children with his love;<br/><br/>
  I would also like to be in the resting place with them,<br/><br/>
  In the arms of our tender Savior Lord.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  I would like to see Him placing His hands over me,<br/><br/>
  And to feel His love embracing me;<br/><br/>
  To enjoy his pleasant glance, and to hear His blessed word;<br/><br/>
  Let the children come to me he now says.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  When I'm kneeling at His platform in a prayer raised to Him,<br/><br/>
  All His love I will then experience;<br/><br/>
  If I know how to seek Him, I will listen to His words;<br/><br/>
  Of the kingdom that He went to prepare.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  There are still so many people who don't know of His home,<br/><br/>
  And they will not receive our Jesus Christ;<br/><br/>
  Oh how I would like to show them that there's a place for them,<br/><br/>
Up in heaven where they could go with me!</p></center>
