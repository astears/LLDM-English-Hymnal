<center><p>561 GRAIN SAND IN THE SEASHORE<br/><br/>
  Grain sand in the seashore, you are oh vile sinner,<br/><br/>
  But the Lord can make, grand temple out of you;<br/><br/>
  Grain sand on the seashore, to make God's own temple,<br/><br/>
  Where the Spirit of the Lord is dwelling more.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  A grain on the sand shore,<br/><br/>
  I was in the desert,<br/><br/>
  A grain in the sand shore, my soul used to be;<br/><br/>
  But I have been called now, to a beautified temple,<br/><br/>
  Where the Spirit of the Lord is dwelling more.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Grain sand in the seashore, in the wide dry desert,<br/><br/>
  And so is the man, in the presence of the Lord;<br/><br/>
  A grain on the sea shore, has been formed a temple,<br/><br/>
  Where the Spirit of the Lord is dwelling more.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Now we are the temple, of God's Holy Spirit,<br/><br/>
  Faithful columns and the support of His truth;<br/><br/>
  Always in our mouths we'll, sing all songs of praises,<br/><br/>
And with them we'll praise the name of Jesus Christ.</p></center>
