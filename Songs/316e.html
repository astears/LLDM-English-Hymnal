<center><p>316 HOLY BOOK<br/><br/>
  Holy book that by God was inspired,<br/><br/>
  It's a fountain truthful and eternal;<br/><br/>
  You have come to break loose all the chains,<br/><br/>
  Of all sin, ignorance, and of fear.<br/><br/>
  You have spoken to us of the mansions,<br/><br/>
  In a far off joyful destiny; Manifested to our eyes you've placed it,<br/><br/>
  What a saint will receive from our God.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  That divine mandate has been so perfect,<br/><br/>
  As it guides every soul so uprightly;<br/><br/>
  And the little ones you love so much,<br/><br/>
  All your teachings can help them to grow.<br/><br/>
  Perfect peace and joy you've given to them,<br/><br/>
  All the mortals who drank from your streams;<br/><br/>
  An immortal reward will be given,<br/><br/>
  If they keep your commands faithfully.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Continue always shining in this world,<br/><br/>
  For there's millions who do not know God's light;<br/><br/>
  May they feel your presence and rejoice,<br/><br/>
  May your name be known throughout the world.<br/><br/>
  Blessed God now come enlighten my mind,<br/><br/>
  So that I may see your perfect truth;<br/><br/>
  Make me guard it obediently always,<br/><br/>
While I praise your fine excellency.</p></center>
