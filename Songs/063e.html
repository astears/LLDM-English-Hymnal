<center><p>063 BLESSED MAY YOU BE<br/><br/>
  Blessed may you be, so full of strength,<br/><br/>
  May God bless you, and be your rampart;<br/><br/>
  You were elected to finish His work,<br/><br/>
  The Lord Christ Jesus bestowed upon you.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  You're an Apostle of our Lord Jesus,<br/><br/>
  And in His divine grace He has sent you;<br/><br/>
  To be announcing His blessed gospel,<br/><br/>
  So he who's wandering will come into God's light.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  You did not know of, God's plan for you,<br/><br/>
  Until you heard from, the voice of God;<br/><br/>
  That voice that told you, &quot;I am your God,&quot;<br/><br/>
  You were elected, Man of our God.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  You're an Apostle, from God on high,<br/><br/>
  We are your children, given from God;<br/><br/>
  You can now say, as Paul once said,<br/><br/>
  We're the seal of your apostleship, Brother.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  The years are passing, so are the times,<br/><br/>
  We are the fruits, of all your sufferings;<br/><br/>
  We are your children, given from God,<br/><br/>
We're the seal of your apostleship, Brother.</p></center>
