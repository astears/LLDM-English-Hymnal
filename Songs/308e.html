<center><p>308 THE PEACE THAT MY FATHER<br/><br/>
  The peace that my Father has placed,<br/><br/>
  Peace that has enlightened my heart;<br/><br/>
  I looked in the world for this peace,<br/><br/>
  And never could I find it here.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Joy and gratitude are in my being,<br/><br/>
  'Cause my Lord on high gave me His spirit;<br/><br/>
  And with His grand love,<br/><br/>
  He's rescued my soul,<br/><br/>
  Oh blessed peace!<br/><br/>
  That God has placed in me.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Christ had suffered much on the cross,<br/><br/>
  Those moments full of anguish and pain;<br/><br/>
  He died as a vile sinner would,<br/><br/>
  With His blood He has cleansed our sins.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  The peace that I give says the Lord,<br/><br/>
  It's not as the world gives their own;<br/><br/>
  It's not like a joy from the world,<br/><br/>
  This peace is a spiritual peace.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  My God has forgiven my sins,<br/><br/>
  With what can I repay my God?<br/><br/>
  Today I'll be faithful to Him,<br/><br/>
Wherever I go I'll proclaim.</p></center>
