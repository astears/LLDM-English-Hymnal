<center><p>542 I'LL FOLLOW YOU<br/><br/>
  I'll follow you Lord Jesus Christ, my Savior and King,<br/><br/>
  Until one day with joy I reach your dwelling up above;<br/><br/>
  So that we may obtain the gift you have prepared for us,<br/><br/>
  If I am faithful in your path until the end.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Never again will I remember this deceiving world of sin,<br/><br/>
  Where without peace my soul wandered rebelliously in sin;<br/><br/>
  But Jesus Christ who is the fount and the spring of purest love,<br/><br/>
  Through his grace salvation was offered to me.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  If I go through temptations, trials and battles in this world,<br/><br/>
  They won't compare to all the joys I'll experience in your home;<br/><br/>
  If I am faithful in all things I know my soul has life,<br/><br/>
  And you'll embrace it then in your arms it will dwell.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  There'll be no tribulation, and no bitterness at heart,<br/><br/>
  In His celestial kingdom we will all live in happiness;<br/><br/>
  Only the songs of singing angels up in heaven will be heard,<br/><br/>
  My soul will gladly sing to him and praises give.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Oh what great love you had for sinners' wickedness my Lord,<br/><br/>
  You left a glorious example for all to follow you;<br/><br/>
  And you had suffered many torments and much bitter pain indeed,<br/><br/>
I am to blame for your death my dearest Lord.</p></center>
