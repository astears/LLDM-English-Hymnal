<center><p>513 IF OTHERS WONDER<br/><br/>
  If others wonder where you will go,<br/><br/>
  Answer delightful , to the city of God;<br/><br/>
  They'll say I never knew of this place,<br/><br/>
  //We're God's chosen people// the new Israel.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Oh blessed City, dwelling of my great King,<br/><br/>
  My soul greatly desires, to dwell in you;<br/><br/>
  The time has passed by quickly, the time has come again,<br/><br/>
  Oh joy divine, to see His blessed face;<br/><br/>
  The Prince of our God.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Beautiful temple, was built with love,<br/><br/>
  A great desire of Brother Aaron;<br/><br/>
  He did not see it, He's gone with God,<br/><br/>
  //Yet it has been built// by the Apostle of God.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  If your disheartened, confide in God,<br/><br/>
  Have faith and courage; don't doubt the Lord;<br/><br/>
  Forgiveness He will give to all souls,<br/><br/>
  //Who come to his path// to serve our God.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Beautiful city, shining with light,<br/><br/>
  Who is there like you, not one is found;<br/><br/>
  Flowing from you are words of life,<br/><br/>
//For in you we find// an Apostle of God.</p></center>
