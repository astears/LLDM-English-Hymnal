<center><p>142 MAY GOD BLESS THE SOULS<br/><br/>
  May God bless the souls who come together,<br/><br/>
  Through ties of sacrosanct love united;<br/><br/>
  May He keep them from all pain and suffering,<br/><br/>
  In this world filled with thorns and with strife.<br/><br/>
  May the home that begins to be formed,<br/><br/>
  With the union of these hearts together;<br/><br/>
  May they always enjoy many blessings,<br/><br/>
  At the shield of the God of Israel.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  As these two are approaching the altar,<br/><br/>
  They have come to swear their faith together;<br/><br/>
  May they always be searching the fountain,<br/><br/>
  The Lord's secret of immortal life.<br/><br/>
  If perhaps there is pain and there's sadness,<br/><br/>
  Which one day may be found as they walk;<br/><br/>
  Only Jesus will give them sweet guidance,<br/><br/>
  And His pathway He'll surely show them.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  May the Lord with His sweet loving presence,<br/><br/>
  Come to give His blessing to this wedding;<br/><br/>
  And through His path of life may He guide them,<br/><br/>
  These who swear loyalty on this day.<br/><br/>
  He'll remind them that nothing in this world,<br/><br/>
  Is eternal all things have an ending;<br/><br/>
  In the meantime with His divine grace,<br/><br/>
They will base all their joy in their God.</p></center>
