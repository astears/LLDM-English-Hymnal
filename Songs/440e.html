<center><p>440 WHAT BEAUTY TO BE<br/><br/>
  What beauty to be, in the arms of Jesus Christ,<br/><br/>
  What beauty to go, from the darkness to His light;<br/><br/>
  To love, always love, Him who gave us light and health,<br/><br/>
  My heart is overflowing, with immense gratitude.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Fill, Jesus Christ all of my heart,<br/><br/>
  Fill it up more and more my Lord;<br/><br/>
  Now that you've pardoned all my sins,<br/><br/>
  Fill it up with your holy love.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Sunk below the tides of sea, I once was living so,<br/><br/>
  And your matchless love, took me from my filthy sins;<br/><br/>
  And to know that everything came from you my Lord,<br/><br/>
  It just makes me want to cry, from immense gratitude.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  //If you want to taste// the love of the Lord,<br/><br/>
  Move close to the Lord, all your sins He will forgive with His love;<br/><br/>
  //If you want to gain// salvation from God,<br/><br/>
Be close to the Lord, you will never find love like our God's.</p></center>
