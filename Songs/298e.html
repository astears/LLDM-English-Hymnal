<center><p>298 THE BIBLE IS THE FLAG<br/><br/>
  The Bible is the flag of, that great eternal city,<br/><br/>
  Its stripes and stars do tell us, the story of its love;<br/><br/>
  A refuge for the poor ones, a place full of redemption,<br/><br/>
  Bought with the blood of Jesus, atonement with great price.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  I am a citizen of that eternal city,<br/><br/>
  By faith I was received there, and citizen I am;<br/><br/>
  Christ is the one who governs in that heavenly land,<br/><br/>
  And when the flag is waving redemption's been announced.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Sixty six stars in number, that are marked on this flag Lord,<br/><br/>
  These represent the books, in her you'll surely find;<br/><br/>
  The stripes twelve count in number, these represent the twelve tribes,<br/><br/>
  The flagpole which it's held by, is the immortal Lamb.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Of many race and nations, of every tribe and language,<br/><br/>
  One country's been created, in Zion up above;<br/><br/>
  Up there when all together, under a flag that's flowing,<br/><br/>
We'll sing up in God's glory, in peace, and redemption.</p></center>
