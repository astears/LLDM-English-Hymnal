<center><p>282 JESUS CHRIST COMES<br/><br/>
  Jesus Christ comes to give gladness, where there is love,<br/><br/>
  He removes all of the sadness, where there is love;<br/><br/>
  Love helps us to come and pray, love can give us great delight,<br/><br/>
  And the darkness turns to light, where there is love.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  //Where there is love//<br/><br/>
  All the world can sing together, where there is love;<br/><br/>
  //Where there is love//<br/><br/>
  Joy and peace always abounding, where there is love.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  All the world just lives in gladness, where there is love,<br/><br/>
  Every heart is elevated, where there is love;<br/><br/>
  All anguish will swiftly pass, and then peace will be enjoyed,<br/><br/>
  And tranquility will abound, where there is love.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Oh what great joy is existing, where there is love,<br/><br/>
  Life can never be depressing, where there is love;<br/><br/>
  Everyone can have joy and peace; sadness will be left behind,<br/><br/>
And the vices are no more, where there is love.</p></center>
