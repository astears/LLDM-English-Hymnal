<center><p>241 HAVE YOU HEARD<br/><br/>
  Have you heard of the story of Jesus?<br/><br/>
  The sweet story of grace and of love;<br/><br/>
  When in weakness and poverty fallen,<br/><br/>
  He redeemed me in His precious love.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  His immense love I am sure of,<br/><br/>
  Nothing will ever have compare;<br/><br/>
  Brilliantly I'm going through life,<br/><br/>
  And heaven's here deep within my soul.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Have you heard that He said to the people:<br/><br/>
  If you're tired you may come to me now?<br/><br/>
  I came to Him and instantly felt there,<br/><br/>
  That the object of His love I was.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Have you heard of those who once in blindness,<br/><br/>
  Into their eyes He gave them His light;<br/><br/>
  And when I was also in the shadows,<br/><br/>
  Jesus came to guide me with His light.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Have you heard of the deep stormy oceans,<br/><br/>
  That the Lord pacified with His voice;<br/><br/>
  You should know that in the roughest torments,<br/><br/>
In my life the Lord came to give peace.</p></center>
