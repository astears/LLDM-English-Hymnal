<center><p>223 PRAISE THE LORD<br/><br/>
  Praise the Lord in highest heavens,<br/><br/>
  That showed human kind His love;<br/><br/>
  Giving to us human creatures,<br/><br/>
  A Savior so powerful.<br/><br/>
  With the hymns of holy people,<br/><br/>
  Sung with ours to make a choir;<br/><br/>
  Of God's praise and gratitude,<br/><br/>
  For our health in this new day;<br/><br/>
  And we say in one loud voice,<br/><br/>
  In the heavens, praise the Lord!<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Let the earth sing of His glory,<br/><br/>
  And be joyful of His love;<br/><br/>
  His peace shines on us forever,<br/><br/>
  'Cause He is our God of love.<br/><br/>
  Every tribe and every nation,<br/><br/>
  Rise up poems towards the heavens;<br/><br/>
  To the King Emmanuel,<br/><br/>
  Who has come from Israel;<br/><br/>
  And they burst in one loud voice,<br/><br/>
  In the heavens, praise the Lord!<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Praise the Lord, the church is singing,<br/><br/>
  'Cause from sin the Lord freed them;<br/><br/>
  Through Christ Jesus who's their Master,<br/><br/>
  Fullness of their heart and souls.<br/><br/>
  Living vigilant and careful,<br/><br/>
  And aware when wars approaching;<br/><br/>
  Until there is peace and rest,<br/><br/>
  In His glory and in peace;<br/><br/>
  Where the righteous sing as one,<br/><br/>
In the heavens, praise the Lord.</p></center>
