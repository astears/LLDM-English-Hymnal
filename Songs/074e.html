  <p>074 LET US SING NOW<br/><br/>
    Let us sing now with jubilee and joy,<br/><br/>
    To Christ our Lord;<br/><br/>
    May He be praised with glories from all nations,<br/><br/>
    From the whole wide world;<br/><br/>
    His hand so strong has redeemed all our spirits,<br/><br/>
    From all evilness;<br/><br/>
    He will complete His promise to all sinners too.<br/><br/>
    CHORUS<br/><br/>
    //Give praises//Let's praise Him from the earth,<br/><br/>
    //Give praises//, with joy and gratitude;<br/><br/>
    //Give praises//, His word commands us now,<br/><br/>
    The Messiah came just like it's announced.<br/><br/>
    2<br/><br/>
    The one desired from all the men on earth,<br/><br/>
    Who has many names;<br/><br/>
    The admirable and wise counselor,<br/><br/>
    He's the Prince of peace,<br/><br/>
    Our strong God and Father for all the ages,<br/><br/>
    The most Divine Judge;<br/><br/>
    All the Lord's sovereign power will reign forever, amen.<br/><br/>
    3<br/><br/>
    A son was born from our eternal father,<br/><br/>
    Our Lord Jesus Christ;<br/><br/>
    Who came to rescue all those blind in darkness,<br/><br/>
    From their slavery;<br/><br/>
    He opened for us a new glorious pathway.<br/><br/>
    Salvation we obtained; <br/>And the church keeps on singing songs of greatest praise.</p>
