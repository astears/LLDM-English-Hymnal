<center><p>073 I WILL SING<br/><br/>
  I will sing from all of my soul to my King,<br/><br/>
  I will give glory, exalting Him;<br/><br/>
  He brought peace to earth, and goodwill to the mortal souls,<br/><br/>
  News of salvation wherever do tell the world.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  I am so happy in Jesus,<br/><br/>
  'Cause He has saved my dear soul,<br/><br/>
  Angels are singing so joyful, for He has redeemed our souls;<br/><br/>
  Oh what a joy is to live life, calmly so full of the faith,<br/><br/>
  I am a pilgrim on this earth;<br/><br/>
  But I walk with Jesus deeply in my heart.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  On the cross in Mount Calvary His flesh ached,<br/><br/>
  He drank the cup full of bitter herbs;<br/><br/>
  And as He expired all the light of sun was dimmed,<br/><br/>
  He was more than a conqueror when He rose up high.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Jesus Christ, ascended far beyond the skies,<br/><br/>
  For me He's pleading with tender love;<br/><br/>
  Soon the Lord will come to this earth again for the saints,<br/><br/>
  Glories ineffable will be to reign with Him.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  What will be in the mansions above of light,<br/><br/>
  When face to face I, will look at Christ;<br/><br/>
  And with joy with Christ as we enjoy the greatness there,<br/><br/>
And many pleasures the faithful will obtain there.</p></center>
