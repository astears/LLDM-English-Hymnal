<center><p>592 I CAN SEE UP IN THE HEAVENS<br/><br/>
  I can see up in the heavens,<br/><br/>
  All the dawning in its brilliance;<br/><br/>
  Like a light giving reflections,<br/><br/>
  Christ, the star alive and shinning; Jesus has illuminated,<br/><br/>
  The path of the sinful man.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  You gave salvation unto my soul,<br/><br/>
  You were my protection and my refuge;<br/><br/>
  All of my sadness has dissipated,<br/><br/>
  Now I live in Christ;<br/><br/>
  Anguish has passed on, and pain has ceased.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Darkness is now disappearing,<br/><br/>
  And the light has come to shine on me;<br/><br/>
  Christ is guiding me by His side,<br/><br/>
  He is showing me His path;<br/><br/>
  I'm a pilgrim on this earth,<br/><br/>
  Towards His mansion I move on.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  There is no doubt in my soul now,<br/><br/>
  Christ gave me His confirmation;<br/><br/>
  I am a witness of His grace,<br/><br/>
  To the people I will say;<br/><br/>
  There is only life in Jesus,<br/><br/>
And forgiveness is through Him.</p></center>
