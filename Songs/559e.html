<center><p>559 ONE MORNING<br/><br/>
  One morning He illuminated my soul,<br/><br/>
  The glorious light of my eternal God;<br/><br/>
  All of the darkness then fled from my soul,<br/><br/>
  Beautiful dawning my soul now enjoys.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  I will give praise only unto God,<br/><br/>
  With the angels up in heaven;<br/><br/>
  In the perfume scented mornings,<br/><br/>
  To my Maker I will sing.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  And in the mornings as I am awake,<br/><br/>
  All the redeemed give their praises to God;<br/><br/>
  They all unite in a beautiful prayer,<br/><br/>
  They sing their hymns sung with might and with zeal.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  My soul is filled with great joy as I sing,<br/><br/>
  When I wake up in the morning with Him;<br/><br/>
  All of the flowers overflow with love,<br/><br/>
  They all exhale tender scents unto God.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  I heard in the deepest part of my soul,<br/><br/>
  A new song that I offered unto God;<br/><br/>
  All of my faults He has forgiven me,<br/><br/>
  With living water that Christ gave to me.<br/><br/>
  5<br/><br/>
  The Lord adorned the blue skies up above,<br/><br/>
  With all the stars with the moon and the sun;<br/><br/>
  In this same way He has transformed my soul,<br/><br/>
  He took the blemishes from my stained heart.<br/><br/>
  6<br/><br/>
  Up in the heights where my mind sometimes goes,<br/><br/>
  I see the dawning of paternal love;<br/><br/>
  Now everything has become light for me,<br/><br/>
I walk with Jesus onward till the end.</p></center>
