<center><p>431 FOR ME THE SAVIOR<br/><br/>
  For me the Savior gave His life,<br/><br/>
  I want to love Him more,<br/><br/>
  Christ Jesus pardoned all my sin,<br/><br/>
  I want to love Him more.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  ///I want to love Him more///<br/><br/>
  Yes, more and more and more;<br/><br/>
  ///I want to love Him more///<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  My Pastor he walks faithfully,<br/><br/>
  I want to love Him more,<br/><br/>
  From the vile tempter,<br/><br/>
  He frees me,<br/><br/>
  I want to love Him more.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  He will never forsake His Church,<br/><br/>
  I want to love Him more,<br/><br/>
  His blessing He will give to them,<br/><br/>
  I want to love Him more.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Oh Prince of the eternal peace,<br/><br/>
  I want to love Him more,<br/><br/>
  In glory I will see His face,<br/><br/>
I want to love Him more.</p></center>
