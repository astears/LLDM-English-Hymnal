<center><p>390 OH SEE HOW PRECIOUS<br/><br/>
  Oh see how precious when we're with Jesus,<br/><br/>
  To love Him always with all our hearts;<br/><br/>
  Leaving this world with all of its glory,<br/><br/>
  All we expect is the protection of our Christ.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Yes, Jesus will come, upon the high clouds,<br/><br/>
  With glory and majesty;<br/><br/>
  He will take His church with Him,<br/><br/>
  For time is ending very soon.<br/><br/>
  //Yes, Jesus will come// He will take His church with Him;<br/><br/>
  For time is ending very soon.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  All of the souls who await in Jesus,<br/><br/>
  They're always watchful living in prayer;<br/><br/>
  They are obeying the good Lord's words,<br/><br/>
  They are all waiting for the blessing of the Lord.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  The cup is waiting up in the heavens,<br/><br/>
  The one Jesus said He would not drink from;<br/><br/>
  Until his people enter triumphal,<br/><br/>
  Giving their loud praises with joy and happiness.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  This is the time that has been announced,<br/><br/>
  When Jesus Christ would make His return;<br/><br/>
  Also Jesus Christ announced and preached it,<br/><br/>
Before the people begin to deny their faith.</p></center>
