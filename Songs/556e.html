<center><p>556 YOUR HOLY WORD<br/><br/>
  Your holy word calls the peoples, every person who has sinned,<br/><br/>
  To fill us with all your love and to give us calmness too;<br/><br/>
  If accepting with all our souls, we will feel it in our hearts,<br/><br/>
  That you truly, Christ our Savior, love us, that is why you died.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Heaven, earth, moon, and the sunshine, everything will pass away,<br/><br/>
  Only your eternal words for the centuries will last.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Your word saving all the sinners, it is life, it's light, and truth,<br/><br/>
  That illuminates toward heaven where you're seated my dear Lord;<br/><br/>
  May I have the honor, Jesus, to always carry your cross,<br/><br/>
  And I'll reach and live in heaven, where you dwell now, my Lord Christ.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Your word is the bread of life 'tis the nourishment for souls,<br/><br/>
  When arriving to the wounded, 'tis relieving and gives peace;<br/><br/>
  Everyone who will receive it, they will never ever die,<br/><br/>
Because you want them forever, to live with you in the sky.</p></center>
