<center><p>370 NOTHING IN THIS WORLD<br/><br/>
  Nothing in this world can satisfy me,<br/><br/>
  As Christ Jesus, my good Savior Lord;<br/><br/>
  Nothing gives my heart more peace and comfort,<br/><br/>
  Only His compassion and great love.<br/><br/>
  And if I owned this whole world entirely,<br/><br/>
  It would not be valuable for me;<br/><br/>
  Because the joy of this world does not fill,<br/><br/>
  It does not give peace like Christ my Lord.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  If my life was filled with many riches,<br/><br/>
  Much fame, glory, and much honor too;<br/><br/>
  But if I did not have hope within me,<br/><br/>
  Of a new life that's better than this.<br/><br/>
  If I had all things but had not Jesus,<br/><br/>
  And His love that nailed Him to the cross;<br/><br/>
  Oh where on this world would I find,<br/><br/>
  Only the Lord gives me peace and light.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Oh how false are all the things in this world,<br/><br/>
  Without Jesus nothing has value;<br/><br/>
  Without Christ there's no joy, life eternal,<br/><br/>
  But eternal darkness and great pain.<br/><br/>
  If I could live without Jesus Christ here,<br/><br/>
  What disgrace to die in wickedness;<br/><br/>
  Without Christ in darkness and in shadows,<br/><br/>
  Without Christ for all eternity.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Oh what joy and peace my Jesus gives me,<br/><br/>
  He does heal me from all of my pains;<br/><br/>
  Only He forgives all my transgressions,<br/><br/>
  He does crown me with His splendor too.<br/><br/>
  If I only have dear Lord Christ Jesus,<br/><br/>
  And from the world nothing I have more;<br/><br/>
  Only He can fill all my desires,<br/><br/>
And in glory I will see His face.</p></center>
