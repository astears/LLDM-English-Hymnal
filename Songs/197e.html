<center><p>197 IN THE MOUNT THAT GOD<br/><br/>
  In the mount made by God, being the Creator,<br/><br/>
  A place full of curse and of shame, a man nailed to a cross;<br/><br/>
  In very great pain,<br/><br/>
  He spilled out His heart,<br/><br/>
  To save from condemnation, all humanity.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Who from your love will take me away?<br/><br/>
  Anguish or the bitter pain;<br/><br/>
  Danger or my nakedness,<br/><br/>
  Hunger or a scorn.<br/><br/>
  Who is the one who will condemn?<br/><br/>
  Lord Christ endured the cross;<br/><br/>
  Eternal life does wait for me,<br/><br/>
  The pain of Jesus Christ was great!<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Eternal loneliness was what he suffered,<br/><br/>
  Despises, curses, mockeries, were all that he endured;<br/><br/>
  The Lamb of our God, His sufferings were great,<br/><br/>
  And all that he suffered, have moved me to praise.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Wisdom from our God, overflowed from His soul,<br/><br/>
  His health was kept by our God, the omnipotent Lord;<br/><br/>
  It was His duty to speak, all of God's truth,<br/><br/>
And He always carried, my burdens for me.</p></center>
