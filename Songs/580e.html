<center><p>580 AS I JOURNEY THROUGH THE LAND<br/><br/>
  As I journey through the land, singing as I go,<br/><br/>
  Pointing souls to Calvaryâ€”to the crimson flow;<br/><br/>
  Many arrows pierce my soul from without, within,<br/><br/>
  But my Lord leads me on, through Him I must win.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Oh, I want to see Him, look upon His face,<br/><br/>
  There to sing forever of His saving grace;<br/><br/>
  On the streets of glory let me lift my voice,<br/><br/>
  Cares all past, home at last, ever to rejoice.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  When in service for my Lord dark may be the night,<br/><br/>
  But I'll cling more close to Him, He will give me light;<br/><br/>
  Satan's snares may vex my soul, turn my thoughts aside,<br/><br/>
  But my Lord goes ahead, leads whatever betide.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  When before me billows rise from the mighty deep,<br/><br/>
  Then my Lord directs my bark; He doth safely keep;<br/><br/>
  And He leads me gently on through this world below,<br/><br/>
He's a real Friend to me, oh, I love Him so.</p></center>
