<center><p>093 WE'RE HAPPY FOR THE LIGHT<br/><br/>
  We're happy for the light that shines in you,<br/><br/>
  A doctrine from the Lord, revealed to you;<br/><br/>
  'Cause God found that your heart was clean from head to toe,<br/><br/>
  For this reason we know that our God sent you.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  To you God gave the most excellent grace,<br/><br/>
  In your heart was raised up God's wonderful love;<br/><br/>
  And you who feel so sorry for the souls,<br/><br/>
  For all who live in error and daily sin;<br/><br/>
  Our freedom you have given: Servant of the Lord.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Rich blessings God has given in your heart,<br/><br/>
  When God tested your heart, you suffered trials;<br/><br/>
  He wanted to choose you, oh Man of God,<br/><br/>
  So you're the one who's guiding, our hearts to God.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  United we have come, aside of you,<br/><br/>
  Admiring the grace, which shines in you;<br/><br/>
  Before the Lord's presence who will bless all our souls,<br/><br/>
With peace and love from heaven, from your strong hand.</p></center>
