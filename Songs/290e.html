<center><p>290 I WAS LOST WHEN JESUS CHRIST FOUND<br/><br/>
  I was lost when Jesus Christ found me,<br/><br/>
  He told me to come to the light;<br/><br/>
  And now He has also permitted,<br/><br/>
  That I take up His cross.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  I shall look upon that radiance from above,<br/><br/>
  You can catch a glimpse right now;<br/><br/>
  A luminary that shines,<br/><br/>
  In the face of Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Then we shall sing so very happy,<br/><br/>
  To Jesus King of glory;<br/><br/>
  And now He has also permitted,<br/><br/>
  That we take up his cross.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Then we continue working harder,<br/><br/>
  The harvest soon shall begin;<br/><br/>
  If we do not become discouraged,<br/><br/>
  He'll give us all our crowns.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  For when you find yourself in heaven,<br/><br/>
  Singing to Jesus our king;<br/><br/>
  And there you shall give your praises,<br/><br/>
For freedom He gave you.</p></center>
