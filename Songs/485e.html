<center><p>485 OH LORD JESUS WHAT BEAUTY<br/><br/>
  Oh Lord Jesus what beauty, the church in which you reign,<br/><br/>
  My soul suspires for this church, it does without a cease.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Come, oh friend come, to God's temple,<br/><br/>
  Oh, come to the home of the Lord;<br/><br/>
  Gives me joy to hear those who do say come now,<br/><br/>
  To the house of our Lord let's proceed.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  My souls filled with great longing, also your church would like to see,<br/><br/>
  And I want to give Jesus, my soul and all my heart.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  One day in your court's better, with you in sanctity,<br/><br/>
  Than thousands filled with happiness, in pathways of evil.<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Blessed are those who enter, the temple of the Lord,<br/><br/>
  For in your grace obtaining, your vigor and your joy.<br/><br/>
  5<br/><br/>
  I do prefer the gateway, the celestial temple Lord,<br/><br/>
Than the uncertain pathways, or worldly joys and bliss.</p></center>
