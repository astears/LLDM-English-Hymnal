<center><p>574 WHAT IF IT WERE TODAY?<br/><br/>
  Jesus is coming to earth again, what if it were today?<br/><br/>
  Coming in power and love to reign, what if it were today?<br/><br/>
  Coming to claim His chosen bride, all the redeemed and purified,<br/><br/>
  Over this whole earth scattered wide, what if it were today?<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  //Glory!// Joy to my heart will bring,<br/><br/>
  //Glory!// When we shall crown Him King;<br/><br/>
  //Glory!// Haste to prepare the way,<br/><br/>
  //Glory!// Jesus will come someday.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  Satan's dominion will then be o'er, oh that it were today?<br/><br/>
  Sorrow and sighing shall be no more, oh that it were today?<br/><br/>
  Then shall the dead in Christ arise, caught up to meet Him in the skies,<br/><br/>
  When shall these glories meet our eyes, what if it were today?<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Faithful and true would He find us here, if He should come today,<br/><br/>
  Watching in gladness and not in fear, if He should come today;<br/><br/>
  Signs of His coming multiply, morning light breaks in t eastern sky,<br/><br/>
Watch for the time is drawing nigh, what if it were today?</p></center>
