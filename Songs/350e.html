<center><p>350 IT IS GLORY JUST TO WALK<br/><br/>
  It is glory just to walk with Him whose blood has ransomed me,<br/><br/>
  It is rapture for my soul each day;<br/><br/>
  It is joy divine to feel Him near where e'er my path be,<br/><br/>
  Bless the Lord, it's glory all the way!<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  //It is glory just to walk with Him//<br/><br/>
  He will guide my steps aright;<br/><br/>
  Through the vale and o'er the height,<br/><br/>
  It is glory just to walk with Him.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  It is glory when the shadows fall to know that He is near,<br/><br/>
  Oh what joy to simply trust and pray!<br/><br/>
  It is glory to abide in Him when skies above are clear,<br/><br/>
  Yes, with Him, it's glory all the way!<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  'Twill be glory when I walk with Him on heaven's golden shore,<br/><br/>
  Never from His side again to stray;<br/><br/>
  'Twill be glory, wondrous glory with the Savior evermore,<br/><br/>
Everlasting glory all the way!</p></center>
