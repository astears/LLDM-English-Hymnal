<center><p>165 THE PEOPLE OF THE LORD<br/><br/>
  The people of the Lord through battle will prepare,<br/><br/>
  And through their holiness, triumphant they will be;<br/><br/>
  They have a helper through, our Savior Jesus Christ,<br/><br/>
  Always He is victorious, against the devil too.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  In the distance we see light, it's the promised land we see,<br/><br/>
  Where all those may rest in peace, who have purity inside;<br/><br/>
  Brother I'm inviting you, to the church of our Lord,<br/><br/>
  So you can participate, of this great blessing too.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  The mountains and the sea, the rain and tempest too,<br/><br/>
  The thunder and the storm, give praises to our Lord;<br/><br/>
  And also in my heart, it praises you my God,<br/><br/>
  On this day of rejoicing in the assembly of God.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Things that the eye can't see, nor that the ear can hear,<br/><br/>
  These have been shown to us, from our Jesus Christ;<br/><br/>
  For His death on the cross, on which He suffered pain,<br/><br/>
He showed us His bright light, His never ending love.</p></center>
