<center><p>444 HOW DULCET IS YOUR NAME<br/><br/>
  How dulcet is your name my Jesus Christ,<br/><br/>
  Bonanza you have placed within my heart;<br/><br/>
  You died on the wood cross, and brought me salvation,<br/><br/>
  By faith I'm walking in your sweet light.<br/><br/>
  You threw my woes away in the depths of the sea,<br/><br/>
  You'll never remember them again;<br/><br/>
  Your blood has cleansed my soul from all iniquity,<br/><br/>
  And your truth was established in me.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  How dulcet is your name my Jesus Christ,<br/><br/>
  You were compassionate towards my soul;<br/><br/>
  You filled me with great health, in all my heart and soul,<br/><br/>
  By your virtue and by your mercy.<br/><br/>
  A song of grace is what I feel within my heart,<br/><br/>
  Your pathway's been a pleasure to me;<br/><br/>
  My eyes are fixed on heaven and now I can see,<br/><br/>
  The glory of your great power, Lord.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  How dulcet is your name my Jesus Christ,<br/><br/>
  The joy will be eternal in your home;<br/><br/>
  Dwellings of jubilee, and plentiful of light,<br/><br/>
  Up there all trials and pains will end.<br/><br/>
  Through your mercifulness give me wisdom to know,<br/><br/>
  Your will so that I may flourish here;<br/><br/>
  According to your word, I know that you'll return,<br/><br/>
Meanwhile do not allow me to fall.</p></center>
