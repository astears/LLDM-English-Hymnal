<center><p>108 JESUS' COMING<br/><br/>
  Jesus' coming, this is certain,<br/><br/>
  'Cause it's written in the Bible;<br/><br/>
  Always faithful to His promise,<br/><br/>
  He will come back for His chosen;<br/><br/>
  Oh look, look at your dear Lord,<br/><br/>
  Also bring the ones who sleepeth;<br/><br/>
  Don't let even one be wandering,<br/><br/>
  He will come! Yes, He will come!<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  He who died on the cross with pain,<br/><br/>
  Gave His life up, never cursing;<br/><br/>
  He comes now, illuminating,<br/><br/>
  So impressive He comes on clouds;<br/><br/>
  Oh look, at your dearest Lord,<br/><br/>
  Oh look at Him come in glory;<br/><br/>
  He is crowned with splendor, victory,<br/><br/>
  He will come! Yes, He will come!<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Crown of thrones placed around His head,<br/><br/>
  Have become red rays around Him;<br/><br/>
  And the staff they made Him carry,<br/><br/>
  Royal scepter of a kingdom;<br/><br/>
  Oh look, at your dear Lord,<br/><br/>
  Saints continue shining brightly;<br/><br/>
  Oh majestic holy angels,<br/><br/>
  He will come! Yes, He will come!<br/><br/>
  4<br/><br/>
  Oh, the one who's absent-minded,<br/><br/>
  He has not believed in Jesus;<br/><br/>
  He has dressed himself with rags,<br/><br/>
  To come to the festive weddings;<br/><br/>
  Oh look, at your dearest Lord,<br/><br/>
  For He's coming, look oh Christ's bride;<br/><br/>
  It's the precious hour ever,<br/><br/>
He will come! Yes, He will come.</p></center>
