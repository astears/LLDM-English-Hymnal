<center><p>163 THIS WORLD IS NOT MY HOME<br/><br/>
  This world is not my home,<br/><br/>
  I'm just a passing through,<br/><br/>
  My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue;<br/><br/>
  The angels beckon me from heaven's open door,<br/><br/>
  And I can't feel at home in this world anymore.<br/><br/>
  CHORUS<br/><br/>
  Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like you,<br/><br/>
  If heaven's not my home then Lord what will I do?<br/><br/>
  The angels beckon me from heaven's open door,<br/><br/>
  And I can't feel at home in this world anymore.<br/><br/>
  2<br/><br/>
  They're all expecting me, and that's one thing I know,<br/><br/>
  My Savior pardoned me, my name was written down;<br/><br/>
  I know He'll take me through, though I am weak and poor,<br/><br/>
  And I can't feel at home in this world anymore.<br/><br/>
  3<br/><br/>
  Just up in glory land we'll live eternally,<br/><br/>
  The saints on every hand are shouting victory;<br/><br/>
  Their songs from sweetest praise drift back from heaven's shore,<br/><br/>
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore.</p></center>
